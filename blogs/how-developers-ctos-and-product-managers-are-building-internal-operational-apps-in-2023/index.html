Internal apps are like secret weapons for businesses. They’re custom-made applications built specifically for internal use, helping teams work smarter and faster. These apps tackle everyday challenges like managing projects, tracking inventory, or streamlining processes. They’re like your personal sidekick, making your work life easier and more efficient. One prominent use case of internal app development is s creating a unified dashboard for sales teams that consolidates data from multiple sources. Sales teams can benefit from this unified dashboard by having a comprehensive view of their sales pipeline, customer interactions, and performance metrics in one place. They can track leads, monitor opportunities, view customer profiles, and access historical data without the need to switch between different applications or interfaces. Making the right call on building internal apps Deciding when to build internal operational apps requires careful consideration of various factors. Here’s a decision matrix that can help guide the decision-making process:\nCustomizability: Off-the-shelf solutions may fall short of meeting unique business requirements. Building an internal app allows for customization, tailored to specific needs.\nIntegration Challenges: Existing systems and tools may require seamless integration. Developing an internal app provides the flexibility to integrate with various APIs and databases.\nData Security: Privacy and data protection are paramount. By building internal apps, businesses can implement robust security measures and ensure compliance with industry standards.\nScalability: As businesses grow, scalability becomes crucial. Internal apps built in-house allow for scalability, accommodating increasing demands and user bases.\nCost-Effectiveness: While building internal apps incurs development costs, it can provide long-term cost savings compared to licensing fees for commercial software.\nInternal operational app checklist User-Friendly UI/UX:\nCraft a seamless user experience with intuitive design, easy navigation, and visually appealing interfaces to enhance user engagement.\nBackend Integration: Integrate your internal app with existing systems and databases to ensure smooth data flow and real-time updates.\nFrontend UI Components:\nUtilize reusable UI components and libraries to accelerate development and maintain consistency throughout the app.\nAuthorization and Authentication: Implement robust security measures by incorporating authorization and authentication protocols to protect sensitive data and ensure access control.\nRole-Based Access: Define user roles and permissions to ensure appropriate data access based on the user’s role within the organization.\nSAML and SSO Integration:\nIntegrate SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) for secure Single Sign-On (SSO), enabling seamless authentication across different systems.\nIntegration with Identity Providers: Implement integrations with identity providers like Okta to enhance authentication, and user management, and ensure a centralized login experience.\nScalability and Performance:\nDesign the app with scalability in mind, ensuring it can handle growing user bases and maintain optimal performance even under high loads.\nAI Assistance: Leverage AI technologies to assist in building internal apps, such as natural language processing for chatbots, machine learning for data analysis, or automated code generation for faster development cycles.\nAnalytics and Monitoring:\nIncorporate analytics tools and monitoring systems to gather valuable insights on app usage, performance, and user behavior, allowing for continuous improvements.\nCross-Device Compatibility: Develop the app to be responsive and compatible across various devices and screen sizes, ensuring a consistent experience for users.\nDocumentation and Support: Provide thorough documentation and ongoing support to assist users in understanding app features and resolving any issues they may encounter.\nHow to start building internal apps 1. Get App Objective Clear\nClearly define the problem your internal app will solve and the goals it aims to achieve.\nUnderstand the purpose of your app to guide the development process and ensure alignment with your organization’s needs.\n2. Decide the Technology\nChoose the Right Development Approach: Select the appropriate development approach based on your resources, skills, and timeline. You can choose between building the app in-house using internal development teams, outsourcing the development to external agencies, or using low-code or no-code platforms for faster development.\nIn recent years, low-code development has emerged as a go-to solution for building internal apps. With low-code platforms like DronaHQ, developers can leverage a visual development approach, enabling them to create powerful internal tools on existing data sources with minimal coding. Low code empowers businesses to accelerate development cycles, enhance collaboration between business and IT teams, and streamline the app creation process.\n3. Build the App\nWhile traditionally coding apps from scratch was the norm, developers are now leveraging the power of low-code tools. With low code, developers can accelerate development cycles, simplify workflows, and achieve faster time-to-market. It’s easy to build apps with drag-and-drop interfaces, pre-built components, and seamless integrations, empowering developers to bring their app ideas to life with speed and efficiency.\n4. Test and Refine\nThoroughly test your internal app to identify and resolve any issues or bugs.\nConduct functional testing, user acceptance testing, and performance testing to ensure high-quality standards.\nGather feedback from users and stakeholders to refine and enhance the app’s functionality.\n5. Launch and Monitor\nDeploy your internal app to a production environment.\nMonitor its performance and ensure it delivers the intended value to users.\nCollect user feedback regularly and iterate on the app to align it with evolving requirements and user needs.\nPutting them all together and choosing the right tech for building internal apps In a nutshell, building internal apps is a journey that requires careful planning, the right technology, and a focus on user needs.
