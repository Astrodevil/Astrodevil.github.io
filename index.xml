Internal apps are like secret weapons for businesses. They&rsquo;re custom-made applications built specifically for internal use, helping teams work smarter and faster. These apps tackle everyday challenges like managing projects, tracking inventory, or streamlining processes. They&rsquo;re like your personal sidekick, making your work life easier and more efficient. </p>
<p>One prominent use case of internal app development is s creating a unified dashboard for sales teams that consolidates data from multiple sources. Sales teams can benefit from this unified dashboard by having a comprehensive view of their sales pipeline, customer interactions, and performance metrics in one place. They can track leads, monitor opportunities, view customer profiles, and access historical data without the need to switch between different applications or interfaces. </p>

<p>I write about my learnings in an explained way through my blogs and socials. If you want to join me on the learning journey, make sure to follow my blogs and social and share yours too. <strong>Let&rsquo;s learn together!🫱🏼‍🫲🏼</strong></p>
<p>This Article is a part of the <a href="https://mranand.com/series/javascript-fundamentals/">JavaScript Fundamentals</a> series.</p>
<h3 id="objects">Objects</h3>
<p>In JavaScript, almost &ldquo;everything&rdquo; is an object. JavaScript objects start with an open curly-brace <code>{</code> and end with a closed curly brace <code>}</code>. It contains key-value pairs in between these braces.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">const</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">team</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#a6e22e">name</span><span style="color:#f92672">:</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;India&#34;</span>,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#a6e22e">wins</span><span style="color:#f92672">:</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">91</span>,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#a6e22e">inFinals</span><span style="color:#f92672">:</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">true</span>,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>};
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In above object <code>team</code>, we have three keys: <code>name</code>, <code>wins</code> and <code>inFinals</code>. The value associated with <code>name</code> is <code>&quot;India&quot;</code>, with <code>wins</code> is <code>86</code> and with <code>inFinals</code> is <code>true</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Let&rsquo;s create an object representing a pizza order! In the <code>order</code> object, add the following three keys with values accordingly:</p>
<p><code>pizzas</code> - Any number greater than zero.</p>
<p><code>extraCheese</code> - A boolean. Either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.</p>
<p><code>deliveryInstructions</code> - Any string of instructions.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">const</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">order</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> {

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>};
</span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id="retrieve-values">Retrieve Values</h3>
<p>Now we will retrieve values from object. From the given code, If we wanted to retrieve the name of the team, we can do this in two ways:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">const</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">team</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> {

</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Brackets <code>[]</code> or <code>.</code> property accessor operator can be used, similar to arrays!</p>
<h3 id="array-of-objects">Array of Objects</h3>
<p>Now, we will see what happens if we put objects inside arrays and vice versa.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take our team example again:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">const</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">team</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> {

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Ending with an extra bit of information about JavaScript&hellip;</p>
<p>A JavaScript object is a state-and-behaviour-containing entity (properties and method). Examples include a car, pen, bicycle, chair, glass, keyboard, and monitor. JavaScript is an object-based language. In JavaScript, everything is an object. JavaScript relies on templates rather than classes. To obtain the object in this case, no class is created. But we deliberately make objects.</p>
<p>It is always a good idea to be careful about modifying objects directly! The function is modifying something outside of its scope, potentially leading to unexpected consequences!</p>
<p><strong>Today I learned about Objects in JavaScript.</strong></p>

<h3 id="arrays">Arrays</h3>
<p>In JavaScript, we use arrays to store a list of elements. An array starts with an open square bracket <code>[</code> and ends with a closed square bracket <code>]</code>. The elements inside the array are separated by a comma <code>,</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Iteration 2:</strong> We find that <code>2</code> is greater than <code>1</code> so we splice at index <code>1</code>. Works fine! <code>i=1</code></p>
<p><strong>Final Iteration:</strong> Array length is <code>2</code> and <code>i=2</code>. Loop condition is that <code>i &lt; array.length</code>, so there are no further iterations at this point. We never removed <code>3</code>!</p>

<p><strong>Final Iteration:</strong> <code>1</code> is not greater than <code>1</code>, so we do not splice it. We are left with <code>[1]</code> in our array, as expected!</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Ending with an extra bit of information about JavaScript functions&hellip;</p>
<p>JavaScript does not care if we modify a value inside the data structure when the word <code>const</code> is used with an object or an array. Arrays are objects, so you may also include arrays while discussing an object&rsquo;s characteristics.</p>
<p><strong>Today I learned about Arrays in JavaScript.</strong></p>

<h3 id="string-looping">String Looping</h3>
<p>Strings are really simple to loop through. We learned how to retrieve characters by using the <code>.length</code> property and <code>[]</code>.</p>
<p>So how can we loop over strings using these?</p>

<h3 id="comparing-strings">Comparing Strings</h3>
<p>String comparison is actually very simple! The comparison operators <code>===</code>, <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> that we studied in earlier lectures can be used.</p>
<p>For <code>===</code>, we may compare the strings case-sensitively to see if they are identical:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#a6e22e">console</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">log</span>( <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;a&#39;</span> <span style="color:#f92672">===</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;a&#39;</span> ); <span style="color:#75715e">// true

</span></span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id="looking-up-characters">Looking up Characters</h3>
<p>Characters in strings can be looked up by index in JavaScript. Square brackets <code>[]</code> or <code>charAt</code> are the two methods available for doing this.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Hello&#34;</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">charAt</span>(<span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>); <span style="color:#75715e">// e

</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">// we are looking up the character at the 1 index, which turns out to be the character e.
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Indexing:</p>
<p><code>H - 0</code></p>
<p><code>e - 1</code></p>
<p><code>l - 2</code></p>
<p><code>l - 3</code></p>
<p><code>o - 4</code></p>
<p>Zero-based indexing is used for strings. This indicates that the index of the first character is <code>0</code>, and it increases by 1 for each additional character.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Complete the <code>startsWithX</code> function to determine if the first character of the <code>string</code> argument is the lower-case <code>x</code>. If the first character is <code>x</code> return <code>true</code>. If not, return <code>false</code>.</p>

<p>Ending with an extra bit of information about JavaScript functions&hellip;</p>
<p>Strings in JavaScript allow us to store text that includes characters, integers, and Unicode and is immutable. Additionally, there are numerous built-in functions in JavaScript for creating and manipulating strings in different ways.</p>
<p><strong>Today I learned about String Manipulation in JavaScript.</strong></p>

<li><strong>Summation</strong> of numbers example:</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&rsquo;s think about how to repeatedly add the digits 1, 2, 3, and 4: The first step is to add 1 to a sum. Then we go to 2, add this to the total, and so on until we get to 4. An iteration occurs each time we add to the total. When the value is more than 4, we iterate until we reach our exit condition.</p>

<li><strong>Factorial</strong> of numbers example:</li>
</ul>
<p>In mathematics, a factorial is often denoted with an exclamation mark <code>!</code>. The sum of all positive integers greater than 0 up to and including the factorial number <code>n</code> is known as a factorial.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at a few examples of factorials:</p>
<p><code>4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24</code></p>
<p><code>3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6</code></p>
<p><code>2! = 2 * 1 = 2</code></p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Taking in some integer value <code>n</code>, find the factorial for that number and return it.</p>

<p><code>%</code> operator is called the modulus operator. It will tell us the remainder of a division. When you divide <code>9</code> by <code>2</code> you get.

<p>Ending with an extra bit of information about JavaScript functions&hellip;</p>
<p>At the beginning of the <code>for</code> loop, the <strong>Initialization</strong> is once executed. Each iteration begins with a check of the <strong>Condition</strong>. The <strong>Statement</strong> will be executed if the expression evaluates to true. If it&rsquo;s untrue, the statement won&rsquo;t execute. Each iteration ends with the <strong>Update</strong> being executed. For the subsequent execution of the <strong>Statement</strong>, it may update a variable. As long as the <strong>Condition</strong> is true, the <strong>Statement</strong> is then executed. The actual work of the loop is completed here.</p>

<p>I write about my learnings in an explained way through my blogs and socials. If you want to join me on the learning journey, make sure to follow my blogs and social and share yours too. <strong>Let&rsquo;s learn together!🫱🏼‍🫲🏼</strong></p>
<p>This Article is a part of the <a href="https://mranand.com/series/javascript-fundamentals/">JavaScript Fundamentals</a> series.</p>
<p>Today, I learned about <code>Math.random</code>, <code>Math.floor</code> Functions and to call a function within our function.</p>
<h3 id="mathrandom">Math.random</h3>
<p>In JavaScript, there are many math utilities on the <code>Math</code> object. To get a random number we can call the <code>Math.random</code> function.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">const</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">myRandomNumber</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> Math.<span style="color:#a6e22e">random</span>();
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The above line will return some number between <code>0</code> and <code>1</code> (not including <code>1</code>). <code>Math.random</code> can also be used to generate random numbers between the range.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Inside <code>getRandom</code>, get a random number from the <code>Math.random()</code> function. Then, return that number!👇🏼</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">function</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">getRandom</span>() {

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>A random number between <code>0</code> and <code>100</code> could be created by simply multiplying the output:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">// randomNumber will be between 0 and 100

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We could multiply and then add to get a random number between <code>15</code> and <code>100</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">// randomNumber will be between 15 and 100

<p><strong>Example:</strong> Take the argument <code>x</code> and use <code>Math.floor</code> to turn it into an integer without the values after the decimal place. Once you have this floored value, return it!</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">function</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">getFloor</span>(<span style="color:#a6e22e">x</span>) {

<p>This Article is a part of the <a href="https://mranand.com/series/javascript-fundamentals/">JavaScript Fundamentals</a> series.</p>
<p>I studied functions yesterday, check the previous <a href="https://astrodevil.hashnode.dev/javascript-fundamentals-mutable-letcomments-functions">article</a>. Today it&rsquo;s time to know more about functions and the use of operators.</p>
<h3 id="parameters-and-arguments"><strong>Parameters and Arguments</strong></h3>
<p>Both the terms <strong>parameter</strong> and <strong>argument</strong> refer to the inputs supplied to a function.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a function with two inputs:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">function</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">addNumbers</span>(<span style="color:#a6e22e">a</span>, <span style="color:#a6e22e">b</span>) {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#66d9ef">return</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">a</span> <span style="color:#f92672">+</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">b</span>;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In the above code, there are two <strong>parameters</strong>: <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>. These are the variables that are defined in the function declaration.</p>
<p>If we were to call this function with two values: <code>2</code> and <code>4</code></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#a6e22e">addNumbers</span>(<span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>, <span style="color:#ae81ff">4</span>);
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The values <code>2</code> and <code>4</code> would be considered <strong>arguments</strong>. Arguments are the data supplied to the function to get filled into parameters.</p>
<h3 id="operators">Operators</h3>
<p>JavaScript operators are symbols that are used to perform operations on operands. These are <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>/</code> .</p>
<p><code>+</code> <strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>The <code>+</code> is referred to as an addition operator.</p>
<p>Complete the <code>addTwo</code> function to take an input and add <code>5</code> to it.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">function</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">addTwo</span>(<span style="color:#a6e22e">input</span>) {

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#66d9ef">return</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">output</span>;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><code>*</code> <strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>The <code>*</code> is referred to as a multiplication operator.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">const</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">a</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>;

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In the above code, <code>b</code> will have the value <code>12</code>! We are using the multiplication operator to multiply <code>3</code> and <code>4</code>.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see with multiple inputs👇🏼by putting multiple inputs under <code>()</code> separated with <code>comma</code>!</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">function</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">product</span>(<span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>,<span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>) {

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><code>/</code> <strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>The <code>/</code> is referred to as a division operator.</p>
<p>Find the average of some numbers:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">const</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">sum</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span> <span style="color:#f92672">+</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">7</span> <span style="color:#f92672">+</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">6</span>;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">const</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">average</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">sum</span> <span style="color:#f92672">/</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Or we can use parenthesis <code>()</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">const</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">average</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> (<span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span> <span style="color:#f92672">+</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">7</span> <span style="color:#f92672">+</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">6</span>) <span style="color:#f92672">/</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In the above code, the sum of <code>2</code>, <code>7</code>, and <code>6</code> is <code>15</code>. Then we divide <code>15</code> by <code>3</code> (<code>15 / 3</code>) to get <code>5</code>.</p>
<p>The parenthesis will always be evaluated first before any other part of the expression.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Ending with an extra bit of information about JavaScript functions&hellip;</p>
<p>Priority is given to division and multiplication above addition and subtraction. Expressions are evaluated from left to right if the precedence of the operators is the same, as it is when division and multiplication are used.</p>

<p>I am going to write about my learnings in an explained way through my blogs and socials. If you want to join me on the learning journey, make sure to follow my blogs and social and share yours too. <strong>Let&rsquo;s learn together!🫱🏼‍🫲🏼</strong></p>
<p>This Article is a part of the <a href="https://mranand.com/series/javascript-fundamentals/">JavaScript Fundamentals</a> series.</p>
<h3 id="mutable-let">Mutable let</h3>
<p>We worked on variables in the last section and now going further with variables, how can we change the stored value inside of a variable?</p>
<p>We used <code>const</code> keyword to declare a constant variable, but if we try to change the value it will give errors.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">const</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">a</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">4</span>;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#a6e22e">a</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">8</span>;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If we try to run above the line, it will give <code>TypeError: Assignment to constant variable</code> . Constants are immutable, meaning their value cannot change.</p>
<p>Here comes the keyword <code>let</code> which allows the value to be mutable (meaning it can change).</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">let</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">a</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">4</span>;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#a6e22e">a</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">8</span>;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The above line will run without error.</p>
<h3 id="comments">Comments</h3>
<p>Comments are an important part of programs. Writing good comments is also necessary to be a good programmer and to write clean code.</p>
<p>Coming up with good variable names is also important.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">const</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">value</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">99</span>;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">const</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">price</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">99</span>;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Both hold the same value <code>99</code> but <code>price</code> is more descriptive.</p>
<p>Comments are only for humans to understand code in a better way. We can write single-line or multi-line comments.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">// this is price in U.S. Dollars
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"></span><span style="color:#66d9ef">const</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">price</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">99</span>;
</span></span></code></pre></div><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">/* The price of all items
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">   Denominated in U.S. Dollars  */</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">const</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">price</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">99</span>;
</span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id="functions">Functions</h3>
<p>A function is a reusable code and it returns an output. The function must be defined before calling it. Function call means to execute the function. The word <em>invoke</em> is also used and the meaning is the same as call.</p>
<p>When a function is called, It means you&rsquo;re passing specific input values.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">const</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">output</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">addOne</span>(<span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>);
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In the code above, <code>addOne</code> is the function and parenthesis <code>( )</code> is used to call the function. We are passing in an input value 5 into our function addOne.</p>
<p>It is not mandatory to have input values in the function. See the below example.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">const</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">message</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">getMessage</span>();
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In order to call a function, we must first define it!</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">function</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">addOne</span>(<span style="color:#a6e22e">input</span>) {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#66d9ef">return</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">input</span> <span style="color:#f92672">+</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In the above code, we are creating a function called <code>addOne</code> which takes one input called input. We are returning the input plus two.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">function</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">getMessage</span>() {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#66d9ef">return</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Hello World!&#34;</span>;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In the above code, function <code>getMessage</code> does not take input. We are simply returning a string, saying &ldquo;Hello World!&rdquo;. The <code>return</code> statement will return the desired output of the function.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">const</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">a</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">addOne</span>(<span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>);
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Variable <code>a</code> is now assigned to the return value of the <code>addOne</code> function invoked with an input of 2, which evaluates to 4.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Ending with an extra bit of information about JavaScript functions&hellip;</p>
<p>If we define/declare a function once, it can be called elsewhere in the program.</p>
<p><strong>Today I learned about Mutable let, Comments, and Functions in JavaScript.</strong></p>

Today is the 1st day of my journey and learned some basic concepts of JavaScript.</p>
<p>I am going to write about my learnings in an explained way through my blogs and socials. If you want to join me on the learning journey, make sure to follow my blogs and social and share yours too. <strong>Let&rsquo;s learn together!🫱🏼‍🫲🏼</strong></p>
<h3 id="introduction-to-javascript">Introduction to JavaScript</h3>
<p>The foundation of contemporary online apps is JavaScript. Although that may sound pretentious or flowery, it is also the reality. JavaScript powers the contemporary web, your contemporary servers, and even the development environments on our computers. Whether it is web 2.0 or web 3.0, JavaScript is used everywhere.</p>
<h3 id="number-variable">Number Variable</h3>
<p>A JavaScript variable is nothing more than a name for a storage area. In JavaScript, there are two different sorts of variables: local variables and global variables. When declaring a JavaScript variable, there are several guidelines (also known as identifiers).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The name must begin with an alphabetical letter (from A to Z), an underscore (_), or a dollar sign ($).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first letter can be followed by any number from 0 to 9, such as the value 1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>JavaScript variables are case-sensitive; for instance, the variables x and X are distinct.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>JavaScript variables are written in <strong>lowerCamelCase.</strong> for example <code>const isLoggedIn = true;</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>JavaScript cares about variables in one word (not separated by space).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We store values in something called a variable.</p>
<p><code>const a = 5</code></p>
<p>In the above code, <code>a</code> is the variable. Number <code>5</code> is the value to be stored in <code>a</code> and <code>const</code> is a keyword used to declare <code>a</code> as a constant value in JavaScript.</p>
<h3 id="multiple-variables">Multiple Variables</h3>
<p>JavaScript programs run line by line, the line <code>const a = 5</code> is called a statement. In JavaScript, statements should end with <code>;</code> (semi-colon). In some cases, JavaScript automatically inserts semi-colons in a statement. The best practice is to insert <code>;</code> at every statement end.</p>
<p>We can create another variable to store the value of the previous variable.</p>
<p><code>const a = 5;</code></p>
<p><code>const b = a;</code></p>
<p>Both <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> will store the value <code>5</code>.</p>
<h3 id="booleans">Booleans</h3>
<p>A JavaScript Boolean represents one of two values: <strong>true</strong> or <strong>false</strong>.</p>
<p><code>const loggedIn = false;</code></p>
<p>If a user is logged in the above line, the <code>false</code> indicated that they are not.</p>
<p>We can also store boolean values inside variables. If we have to store <code>true</code> in one variable and <code>false</code> in another variable, then:</p>
<p><code>cont a = false;</code></p>
<p><code>const b = true;</code></p>
<h3 id="quotes">Quotes</h3>
<p>Both single <code>' '</code> and double <code>&quot; &quot;</code> quotes can be used when declaring JavaScript strings.</p>
<p>Here, we used double quotes so we could use a single quote inside the message:</p>
<p><code>const message = &quot;Hello, hope you are doing fine!&quot; ;</code></p>
<p>If we needed to use double quotes:</p>
<p><code>const message = 'Then he said, &quot;Hey, are you coming home?&quot;';</code></p>
<p>If we needed to use a double quote inside double quote string, we can use a backslash <code>\</code> as an escape character:</p>
<p><code>const message = &quot;This is double-quote \&quot; inside double-quotes&quot;;</code></p>
<h3 id="strings">Strings</h3>
<p>Strings in JavaScript are used to store and modify text. A string in JavaScript is zero or more characters enclosed in quotes.</p>
<p>Strings are nothing but a bunch of characters (<code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>c</code>) put together.</p>
<p>In JavaScript, there are three ways to define a string. first two of them are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>const a = &quot;Hello!&quot;;</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Here, <code>myName</code> and <code>anotherName</code> uses two different types of quotes, single and double. We can use either one or inside of each other.</p>
<p><code>const myName = 'Anand';</code></p>
<p><code>const anotherName = &quot;Vishal&quot;;</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now look at the third method to declare strings:</p>
<p><code>const helloMessage = `Hello ${myName}, my name is ${anothername}!`;</code></p>
<p>Here, <code>helloMessage</code> variable uses backticks <code>`</code> . With backticks, we can add values inside the strings. The <code>${variable}</code> is about this. In the above line of code, we are taking value from <code>myName</code> and <code>anotherName</code> and placing them into strings. The variable <code>helloMessage</code> now contains <code>&quot;Hello Anand, my name is Vishal!&quot;</code></p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Ending with an extra bit of information about JavaScript&hellip;</p>
<p>JavaScript also uses <strong>upper snake case</strong> sometimes like <code>const SERVER_KEY_VALUE = &quot;abcdefg&quot;;</code> This casing is typically reserved for environment variables or values that are needed to be determined before code executions. Like, if you have some secret key that you want to store on the server but not on the local machine, then You might keep that variable tucked away on the server in an environment variable that will require permissions to access or change. These are the types of variables we&rsquo;ll often see with this casing.</p>
<p><strong>Today I learned about Number variables, multiple variables, booleans, quotes and strings in JavaScript.</strong></p>

Long time no see. <strong>2022</strong> is going to end in a few days. In this article, I am going to talk about myself, what I achieved, and my failures this year.</p>
<p>**2023 is already knocking at the doors!**🎅🏼</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to celebrate the past year&rsquo;s achievements and learn from the mistakes of 2022. Thanks to Hashnode for organizing the <strong>&ldquo;Dev Retro 2022&rdquo;</strong> campaign.</p>
<h2 id="achievements">Achievements🎉</h2>
<h3 id="blogs">Blogs</h3>
<p>Published 6 Articles on my <strong>Blog</strong> this year. Not a great number but I am happy with not quitting due to lack of ideas and time.</p>
<p>Writing is something that made me explore things I didn&rsquo;t even think of. Tech Twitter has changed my life very much, So much to learn from there, seeing good folks there and learning from them is great. Sometimes article ideas just come from Twitter and a little bit of research is over the top of it.</p>

<h2 id="failures">Failures🚨</h2>
<p>Honestly, I am not happy with my 2022 work and learning.</p>
<p>Not finishing what I started to learn, be it DSA or Web development. Not written as many blogs as I planned a year back. Lots of mismanagement happened due to shifts in my college work. I had online classes till the first half of 2022 and after that, I got to attend offline classes. this messed up my whole planning and I wasn&rsquo;t able to manage it well.</p>
<p>Mistakes are never meant to be repeated and I am keeping them in check from now on. Offline classes and semester exams had taken lots of time and mismanagement adds fire to that. I can&rsquo;t repeat these mistakes in 2023. I didn&rsquo;t compete for my bigger goal this year.</p>
<h2 id="2023-goals">2023 Goals🎯</h2>
<p>I am not aiming too high for the next year&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Just want to finish what I started to learn.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Will contribute to open source on a more regular basis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Writing articles more often.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finding Internships or Technical writing opportunities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="wrap">Wrap🧵</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to learn from mistakes than get into repentance. This time with proper time management. I know now that my classes are offline and learning will be planned accordingly. My Internship season is approaching soon and I have to be ready for that. Lots of things to be achieved but have to go one step at a time.</p>
<p>I am going to be more active this time on Twitter and will continue to load my Instagram with lots of Tech content. Will be learning &amp; creating content in public.</p>
<p>Lots of good content in 2023!👍🏼</p>

I am going to share the step-by-step method I followed while building a blog website using a static site generator <strong><a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a></strong> and deploying it to <strong>Netlify</strong>. I encountered some small errors during the process, I am gonna entertain those as well. Let&rsquo;s get started.</p>
<p>As I am using windows, commands may be different, follow <a href="https://gohugo.io/documentation/">official docs</a> while building your own website using Hugo. Also, I am running all commands on git bash.</p>
<h2 id="step-1">Step 1</h2>
<p>Create any folder on Desktop and open <code>git bash</code>. Now time to install hugo.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>choco install hugo -confirm
</code></pre><p>Or if you need the “extended” Sass/SCSS version: for some supported theme. Better install it from <code>cmd</code> by running it as administrator.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>choco install hugo-extended -confirm
</code></pre><h2 id="step-2">Step 2</h2>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s time to create a new website and add a cool theme to it. You can choose any theme from the Hugo theme library. Run below commands.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>// Choose your site name in place of blognerd

hugo new site blognerd
</code></pre><p>The above will create a new Hugo site in a folder named <code>blognerd</code>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to add theme to the site. See <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/">theme library</a> for a list of themes to consider. I am using <code>Beautiful Hugo</code> theme.</p>

<pre tabindex="0"><code>echo theme = \&#34;beautifulhugo\&#34; &gt;&gt; config.toml
</code></pre><h2 id="step-3">Step 3</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to add some contents to the newly created site. You can also add them manually but I am creating this using commands.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>hugo new posts/my-first-post.md

In this article, I am going to share my experiences from being a contributor in an open-source program to the project admin &amp;amp; mentor of one.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>GSSoC stands for <a href="https://gssoc.girlscript.tech/">GirlScript Summer of Code</a>. It is a three-month-long Open-Source Program conducted by the GirlScript Foundation for beginners. This year I am selected as project admin for the program. (GSSOC'22)</p>
<p>In this article, I am going to share my experiences from being a contributor in an open-source program to the project admin &amp; mentor of one.</p>
<h3 id="how-i-started">How I started?</h3>
<p>My first open-source contribution was to a friend&rsquo;s repository. After doing some small contributions I came to know about GSSoC program and I took part in it. This was the first big contribution from my side to any open source project. Before that, I had some experience contributing to <strong>EbookFoundation / free-programming-books</strong>. From that, I learned to communicate over issues and to make pull requests properly. This previous work helped me a lot during GirlScript Summer of Code.</p>
<h3 id="what-i-learned">What I Learned?</h3>
<p>Successful contributions during the program definitely acted as a confidence booster for me. Now, I was more confident to work on any open-source project. While contributing I went through some issues and pull requests where project maintainers were discussing things and I tried to understand their workflow, and how they manage things.</p>
<p>After some time, I decided to take part as a project admin in an open-source program. Hacktoberfest was the best time to do so because many newbies were going to start their open source contributions in the month of October.</p>
<h3 id="what-next">What Next?</h3>
<p>I had created a repository to host small JavaScript projects. It was for personal use first but after the decision of participating as a project admin, I created a GitHub organization <a href="https://github.com/ZeroOctave">ZeroOctave</a> and added the same repository inside that. Hacktoberfest was going to start so I thought of taking my chances and as expected some good contributions were added to the repository. I was enjoying my role as a maintainer while guiding contributors for the contribution to my repository.</p>
<p>Just after Hacktoberfest, some more open-source programs were going to start so I applied with my repository and got accepted in two of them. Those programs were <a href="https://icc-techsahead.netlify.app/">Infinite Clone Conspiracy</a> &amp; <a href="https://dwoc.io/">DWoC'21</a>. These programs were not big enough to attract many contributors but still some good projects were added to our repository and some new members also joined the GitHub organization.</p>
<h3 id="gssoc">GSSoC!</h3>
<p>GSSoC stands for <s>Google</s> GirlScript Summer of Code. As I mentioned earlier, GSSoC'21 acted as the starting step for my open source journey. After 1 year when another version of GSSoC came back, I decided to participate in my project this time. I filled out the registration form with my organization and project details and got selected as project admin. It&rsquo;s a 3-month long program currently going on, many new contributions are coming into our organization repository. <a href="https://github.com/ZeroOctave/ZeroOctave-Javascript-Projects">ZeroOctave Javascript Projects</a> is our project repository that is the part of GSSoC'22. Till now 200+ issues created and 200+ pull requests merged.</p>
<p>While doing my work as project admin and coordinating with my project maintainers, I am also focused on enhancing my tech skills. So that I can contribute to some good open-source projects out there.</p>
<h3 id="invitation-for-you">Invitation For You!</h3>
<p>If you are a beginner, you are welcome to contribute to our organization. If you are an active open source contributor or maintainer, you are welcome to join ZeroOctave. Join zeroOctave to add your projects, guide newbies or write articles related to open source.</p>

In the software industry, Open Source projects are widely regarded now. How can recruiters know that the abilities you claim to have are truly the skills you have? When you&rsquo;re a fresher with no professional experience open-source contributions come in useful. Without any prior industry expertise, GitHub allows you to exhibit your work. As a result, it&rsquo;s important to make GitHub Profile stand out and present the best version of yourself.</p>
<p>In this article, I am shedding light on tips to <strong>Make Your GitHub Profile Standout To Attract Better Opportunities</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction!</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Astrodevil"><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1643986105138/0oFtVvL6rO.png" alt="screely-1643985124626.png"  />
</a></p>
<p>The above screenshot is of my GitHub profile. I have mentioned my bio in a detailed manner, including contribution graphs, badges, tech stack, proper name, username, profile picture, social handles, and my side hustles. You can also create your GitHub profile like mine or even better. Isn&rsquo;t my profile more detailed and attractive than resume? I hope after seeing the above screenshot you also want to make your GitHub profile stand out. <em>Let&rsquo;s get started!</em></p>
<h2 id="foundation-stone">Foundation Stone</h2>
<p>As you know already, the repository is the main feature of GitHub where every project, content, code is stored properly.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start by creating a special repository after signing in to your GitHub account. <strong>This repository name must be same as your GitHub username</strong>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1643985010957/IkhnHnKtE.png" alt="screely-1643984983985.png"  />
</p>
<p>This is a ✨special ✨ repository that you can use to add a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes">README.md</a> to your GitHub profile. Make sure it’s public and initialize it with a README or create a README.md file inside this repository to get started.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> will be used to add contents and details in <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes">README</a> file. Learn Markdown syntax from this <a href="https://github.com/Astrodevil/Open-Source-Gallery/blob/main/src/markdown-cheatsheet.pdf">cheetsheet</a>. README files are commonly used to write documentation for the project repositories.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to add contents in your profile README.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3 id="header">Header</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the header, you can add your name, greet message, photo or gif, or nothing according to your choice. I am using my profile-related codes, you can change accordingly.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code># Hi, I&#39;m Astrodevil &lt;img src=&#34;https://github.com/TheDudeThatCode/TheDudeThatCode/blob/master/Assets/Hi.gif&#34; width=&#34;29px&#34;&gt;

<ul>
<li>
<h3 id="contribution-graph">Contribution Graph</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I have added a contribution graph banner to update daily activity from my GitHub profile. It&rsquo;s a nice way to showcase if you are active frequently and doing some contributions in projects. This graph is updating daily automatically.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code> # replace username with your own or change theme

</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3 id="icons--badges">Icons &amp; Badges</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Adding <strong>social handles</strong> on GitHub profile is the best way to connect with peoples and transfer more audience towards your socials. You can use badges for that or icons. You can create badges from <a href="https://shields.io/">shields.io</a> and also use icons from <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/social-media">flaticon</a>. There are tons of site to find attractive icons. You can also add information about your tech stack and tools you are familiar with by using badges and icons.

</p>
<p>These are the basic customization method that can make your GitHub profile stand out, I used my profile as an example to explain above. You can also add more customization in your GitHub profile README to make it detailed and attractive. <em>Let&rsquo;s see that in next section</em>.</p>
<h2 id="building">Building</h2>
<ul>
<li>You can also <strong>track your activity</strong> and showcase it on your profile README by using a GitHub Action Scripts. Just create <code>/.github/workflows/update-readme.yml</code> inside the repository and paste below code inside update-readme.yml file. This script updates activity every 30 minutes.</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>name: Update README

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: jamesgeorge007/github-activity-readme@master
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
</code></pre><p>Add this block to README.md file where you want to showcase your recent activity</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>
&lt;!--START_SECTION:activity--&gt;
&lt;!--END_SECTION:activity--&gt;

</p>
<h2 id="final-touch">Final Touch</h2>
<ul>
<li>

Database concepts such as the classic relational model, the document model, and graph-based models are investigated. The implementation of data storage and retrieval in databases is then thoroughly explained.

The distinctions between OLTP and OLAP are presented in a tabular manner. There is a nice introduction to message brokers, protocolbuf, thrift, and avro.</p>

<h3 id="what-exactly-is-no-code">What exactly is no-code?</h3>
<p>Programming without code is a concise definition. It is the use of no-code tools that allow you to create a fully functional, responsive web application or website without writing any code. However, it goes a little deeper than that.</p>
<p>Every piece of technology, including no-code platforms, is developed with code. The distinction is that no-code platforms provide building elements that are required by any website or application, such as pages, data storage and display, individual user profiles, and file upload. People may then link them into their own program using drag and drop or other &ldquo;human-understood&rdquo; actions that do not require coding.</p>

They are just starting their open-source journey and making mistakes. In the beginning, making mistakes is not a bad thing. But, correctly contributing to open-source projects is also very important.</p>
<p>In this article, I am going to discuss some tips on - <strong>How Not to contribute to Open-Source on GitHub</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-projects">Understanding Projects</h2>
<p>Understanding of project like how folders are arranged? how files are linked? which tech stack is used? is the most important thing before raising an issue or making a pull request in any project on GitHub.</p>
<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t</strong> make pull requests or raise issues without reading contributing guidelines of any projects. Always read the <a href="https://github.com/ZeroOctave/ZeroOctave-Javascript-Projects/blob/main/README.md">README.md</a> file of projects where everything related to the project is written most of the time. Also, clone the project in your machine and go through every file once to understand its working.</p>
<h2 id="raising-issue">Raising Issue</h2>
<p>If you want to solve any bug or to contribute some lines of code to a project then you have to raise an issue. But always check the previous issues raised by anyone else to confirm, if anyone else is working or described the same issue that you gonna solve.</p>
<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t</strong> raise 1 or 2-word issue, that doesn&rsquo;t make sense to anyone else. Always remember to add proper details/context in the issue because the issue is like a chain of conversation related to changes you or anyone else wants to make in the project. Write a proper description and proper title to the issue also add screenshots, links, information, or an approach to solve that issue to proper understanding. Make issues such that project maintainers or contributors understand your views and suggestions quickly.</p>
<p>✅<strong>Do this</strong>

<h2 id="making-pull-request">Making Pull Request</h2>
<p>Your PR should do one thing. Always make a pull request for one part or section so that it would be easier for reviewers and maintainers to merge your pull request. If you are solving multiple issues in a project then open multiple PRs.</p>
<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t</strong> make multiple PRs in one, this is confusing sometimes and also delayed the merging process. Let&rsquo;s assume you are making a PR for a new feature in the project and you also found a bug related to a different part of the same project. Don&rsquo;t fix that bug in the same PR. Because sometimes the other changes that gonna add value to the project get delayed due to multiple PRs in one. Make PRs small and on point, which will help your pull request getting merged easily.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t</strong> open a PR like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixes bug #343</li>
<li>Adds new linting rules</li>
<li>Includes feature #466</li>
</ul>
<p>Attaching screenshots or some information related to your changes in the PR description is also very good practice. This will help the maintainer or reviewer to differentiate between changes.</p>
<p>✅<strong>Do this</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1635357710905/HhuZ6VeLi.png" alt="Screenshot 2021-10-27 233035.png"  />
</p>
<p>❌<strong>Don&rsquo;t do this</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1635357822392/sJpdNHose.png" alt="Screenshot 2021-10-27 233332.png"  />
</p>
<h2 id="approvals-and-dead-prs">Approvals and Dead PRs</h2>
<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t</strong> start working on any project before the maintainer gives you a go-ahead or assigned that issue to you. Don&rsquo;t open pull requests immediately. Wait for the maintainers approval</p>
<ul>
<li>If the issue is already open and not assigned to anyone, ask maintainers if you can work on that.</li>
<li>Start work on your PR.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t ask maintainers to assign you an issue that is already assigned to someone else.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes you get confused during working on PR maybe you lost interest or whatever reasons please don&rsquo;t leave that open PR as it is, make sure to close that <strong>dead PR</strong>. The maintainer may not want to close it because they don&rsquo;t want to upset you. It neither looks good for the project nor to you. You can always reopen the Pull request if you want to work on that in the future.</p>
<h2 id="be-meaningful">Be Meaningful</h2>
<p>Every contribution is valuable. If something is broken in the project like an important link is not working in the documentation that will be needed to be fixed. But if you just change an emoji from ⚡ to 🚀, this is not much valuable.</p>
<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t</strong> break consistency.</p>
<ul>
<li>Every time make sure to follow proper file order and directory to commit changes.</li>
<li>Removing semicolons, adding spaces, or making text bold in the project that doesn&rsquo;t prefer them.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="hassling-maintainers-to-merge">Hassling Maintainers To Merge</h2>
<p>When you create any pull request or issue I know you get excited. Maintainers will get a notification that you raised or crested. You don&rsquo;t need to add additional comments and tag them. If it&rsquo;s taking time, give them a friendly call in comments that will be fine.</p>
<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t</strong> hassle them on DMs on Twitter, Discord, Linkedin, or any other socials by sending them links of your issue or PRs. They are getting notifications from projects they maintain and you are adding more notifications. This will create more confusion for maintainers. Remember, most of these people maintaining projects are from different time zones. Many of them are maintaining open-source project in addition of their work. Be patience! You can give them a friendly reminder after 1 week or such.</p>
<p>✅<strong>Do this</strong></p>

How you can code something interesting and then view its fascinating outcomes. But Doing it in the right way is also very important. While scrolling YouTube I found a video where some developers and community leaders were sharing their tips about programming.</p>
<p>In this Article, I am going to share <strong>20 Top Tips From The Coding Community</strong></p>
<h3 id="1-use-google">1. Use Google</h3>
<p>The developers&rsquo; best friend is Google. I don&rsquo;t know who you are or how much experience you have, no one can remember everything. Learning how to google things itself is a required skill every developer should have. Finding resources to learn or to fix bugs google is going to help you with everything related to your coding journey. Googling is an Art! Learn it.</p>
<h3 id="2-pick-tech-you-like">2. Pick Tech You Like</h3>
<p>Choose something you like. JavaScript is trending now in web development, if you like it Great!. If you are not intrested in web development fine! choose App development or some other tech. just make sure to learn something you like.</p>
<h3 id="3-learn--code">3. Learn &amp; Code</h3>
<p>Always learn &amp; code at the same time. This will help you to understand concepts properly. If you are learning something solve some questions related to the concepts.</p>
<h3 id="4-support-other-learners">4. Support Other Learners</h3>
<p>If your classmates or someone is learning something or creating something. Help them with your knowledge, Support them. Supporting someone will going to help you to become a good developer. Talks about the things they did great, talk about the things they need to work upon. Don&rsquo;t humiliate by saying every time: hey you are wrong! this sucks! that&rsquo;s bad, Instead talk about it and explain the solution.</p>
<h3 id="5-write-out-your-problem">5. Write Out Your problem</h3>
<p>Suppose you have a coding issue, when you write it out and started explaining it to someone you end up explaining it in your own brain. Sometimes You already figures out the answer before you even going to ask someone by seeing what you have written. So write out your problems before code.</p>
<h3 id="6-build--practice">6. Build &amp; Practice</h3>
<p>If you are learning to code, practice is the most important thing to follow across the learning period. Don&rsquo;t stuck in tutorial hell. Learn and practice to get better.
Suppose you are learning web development, create mini-projects after clearing every concept, and implement it.</p>
<h3 id="7-go-at-your-own-pace">7. Go At Your Own Pace</h3>
<p>This is not a competition. If it takes you a long time to understand concepts, it&rsquo;s OK. Don&rsquo;t compare yourself with others, everyone&rsquo;s mind is different. At the end of the day, the only thing matters are what you learned. Go Slowly! Believe in Yourself!</p>
<h3 id="8-error-messagebugs">8. Error Message/Bugs</h3>
<p>Error messages and bugs are your friends now. Get comfortable with these while coding, it&rsquo;s a part of the job. It&rsquo;s going to help you a lot.</p>
<h3 id="9-take-small-breaks">9. Take Small Breaks</h3>
<p>Always take small breaks between coding sessions, get up from the chair drink water. walk for 5 minutes, see outside the window, and get relaxed. this will boost your productivity.</p>
<h3 id="10-dealing-with-imposter-syndrome">10. Dealing With Imposter Syndrome</h3>
<p>Remember that no one knows everything and you are not expected to know everything. So, admit when you don&rsquo;t completely understand something so that others around you can help you and celebrates your win. No matter how big or small they are, when you look back at the time when you first started learning. You are going to see how far you came, Never give up.</p>
<h3 id="11-fun-based-learning">11. Fun Based Learning</h3>
<p>When you code something and going to deploy it remember programming should always be fun. Create small side projects to learn things. Maybe a small game you made helps you to understand the concept faster. when you start enjoying the coding process, you will be going to be a good developer.</p>
<h3 id="12-timebox-when-you-are-stuck">12. Timebox When You Are Stuck</h3>
<p>If you gonna struggle with a problem, give yourself some time like 30 minutes or 1 hour but in limit before going to ask someone or to take help. Neither ask early nor stuck for too long.</p>
<h3 id="13-focus-on-small-things">13. Focus On Small Things</h3>
<p>Improve yourself every day, fix a time slot to code every day. like you decided to code for 3 hours daily, so follow this. Don&rsquo;t miss these 3 hours. Coding daily will boost your confidence as well as problem-solving skills. These small things matter. Small things make huge differences. Assess your silly mistakes while doing code to improve yourself.</p>
<h3 id="14-explore--be-passionate">14. Explore &amp; Be Passionate</h3>
<p>Always keep exploring new things in the programming world and be passionate about what you are doing or learning. New things always keep coming, find and know about it, keep yourself updated with the latest tools and trends in the coding world. Mastering what you learn but keeping knowledge of changing tech is equally important.</p>
<h3 id="15-real--desired-projects">15. Real &amp; Desired Projects</h3>
<p>Making small projects while learning is a good thing. But when it comes to jobs having a better side project will give you an edge over others. Just make a project which you want to see in this world, give it a try make your imagination real. Failing is OK, at least you should try.</p>
<h3 id="16-find-a-mentor-and-work-with-experienced-peoples">16. Find A Mentor and Work With Experienced Peoples</h3>
<p>Having a good mentor is all you need to grow in the industry or to come out of problems by following the right path. Mentors can guide you to what you need to learn and what not to.</p>
<p>Working with experienced people helps you to learn from their experiences. while working they can share some insights which will make your life easier in the coding world.</p>
<h3 id="17-find-your-community">17. Find Your Community</h3>
<p>Community is everything in this industry. Connecting with people of similar interests and fields is all you need to get better. Having in some good communities is the best thing you can do to grab opportunities and to take help and do help.</p>
<h3 id="18-physical-and-mental-health">18. Physical and Mental Health</h3>
<p>Staying fit is a huge challenge nowadays. Sitting on a chair for long durations while coding can make you unhealthy, so take proper care of your health. It&rsquo;s most important. Exercise daily! Drink lots of water! Walk around the city! Eat healthily and use the proper desk setup for coding. Do meditation in the morning and wash your eyes with cold water thrice a day. Eyes are most exposed to bright desktop screens.</p>
<h3 id="19-document-and-share-experiences">19. Document And Share Experiences</h3>
<p>No matter what you learned or achieved, document your journey. Sometimes during your learning process, you got stuck but get the solution after some time. Do share it with the world by writing blogs or making videos. Your experiences gonna help others.</p>
<h3 id="20-contribute-to-open-source">20. Contribute To Open-Source</h3>
<p>Because most coders overlook open-source contributions, I&rsquo;m writing this in the final section of this article. You&rsquo;ve studied everything, but how will you use your knowledge to work on a vast codebase if you don&rsquo;t understand how real-world projects work? It&rsquo;s also critical to have a thorough understanding of real-world software and projects. Start contributing to open source to help you achieve your goals.</p>
<h3 id="some-bonus-tips">Some Bonus Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Learn In Public:</strong> Post your daily learning on Twitter or LinkedIn. This will help you as well as others. By doing this, you are making yourself more open to job opportunities.</li>
<li><strong>Use Stack Overflow:</strong> If You get stuck in coding problems and find solutions later share it there so that anyone facing the same issue in the future can take help from it.</li>
<li><strong>Some Apps For Student Developers:</strong>  Gaming apps to social media apps, everyone is using different apps. But having some proper apps to increase your productivity and boost your coding journey is also important.
