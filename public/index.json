If you want to join me on the learning journey, make sure to follow my blogs and social and share yours too. Let\u0026rsquo;s learn together!🫱🏼‍🫲🏼\nThis Article is a part of the JavaScript Fundamentals series.\nObjects In JavaScript, almost \u0026ldquo;everything\u0026rdquo; is an object. JavaScript objects start with an open curly-brace { and end with a closed curly brace }. It contains key-value pairs in between these braces.\nconst team = { name: \u0026#34;India\u0026#34;, wins: 91, inFinals: true, }; In above object team, we have three keys: name, wins and inFinals. The value associated with name is \u0026quot;India\u0026quot;, with wins is 86 and with inFinals is true.\nExample: Let\u0026rsquo;s create an object representing a pizza order! In the order object, add the following three keys with values accordingly:\npizzas - Any number greater than zero.\nextraCheese - A boolean. Either true or false.\ndeliveryInstructions - Any string of instructions.\nconst order = { pizzas: 5, extraCheese: true, deliveryInstructions: \u0026#34;Keep it medium\u0026#34;, }; Retrieve Values Now we will retrieve values from object. From the given code, If we wanted to retrieve the name of the team, we can do this in two ways:\nconst team = { name: \u0026#34;India\u0026#34;, wins: 91, inFinals: true, }; console.log( team.name ); // India console.log( team[\u0026#39;name\u0026#39;] ); // India Brackets [] or . property accessor operator can be used, similar to arrays!\nArray of Objects Now, we will see what happens if we put objects inside arrays and vice versa.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s take our team example again:\nconst team = { name: \u0026#34;India\u0026#34;, wins: 91, inFinals: true, }; What if we have multiple teams:\nconst teams = [India, Australia, England]; for(let i = 0; i \u0026lt; teams.length; i++) { console.log(teams[i].name); } This example loops over each team and logs out the name of each team.\nExample: Given an array of pizza orders, return the total number of pizzas ordered. The orders are an array of objects, each with pizzas key inside.\nfunction numberOfPizzas(orders) { let total = 0; for(let i = 0; i \u0026lt; orders.length; i++) { total += orders[i].pizzas; } return total; } Enumerated Types When numbers are defined, code is easier to read and maintain. Consider the following instance:\nconst card = { suit: 1, value: 5 } Spades, Clubs, Hearts, and Diamond cards are suits.\nWhat is the suit of this card? We are aware that the value is 1, but what does that actually mean? Let\u0026rsquo;s define CARD_SUITS:\nconst CARD_SUITS = { DIAMONDS: 0, HEARTS: 1, SPADES: 2, CLUBS: 3 } We can identify our card suit by using this object:\nconst card = { suit: CARD_SUITS.HEARTS, value: 5 } It only needs to be changed once in CARD_SUITS if we ever wish to change which suit belongs to which value. This type of object is commonly referred to as an Enumeration.\nExample: Let\u0026rsquo;s create an enumeration like CARD_SUITS above. Our enumeration will be named ORDER_TYPES and describe the different types of orders that are possible in our system. The first type should be PIZZA, with a value of 0. After that, create at least 2 more options of your choice!\nconst ORDER_TYPES = { PIZZA: 0, WINGS: 1, SALAD: 2, } Importing Files Let\u0026rsquo;s import the ORDER_TYPES we just created into numberOfPizzas.js.\nWe can use require to pull in the exports from orderType.js:\nconst ORDER_TYPES = require(\u0026#39;./orderTypes\u0026#39;); Example: Modify the numberOfPizzas function to only count pizzas when the order.type is equal to ORDER_TYPES.PIZZA.\n// orderTypes.js const ORDER_TYPES = { PIZZA: 0, WINGS: 1, SALAD: 2, } // numberOfPizzas.js const ORDER_TYPES = require(\u0026#39;./orderTypes\u0026#39;); function numberOfPizzas(orders) { let total = 0; for(let i = 0; i \u0026lt; orders.length; i++) { if (orders[i].type === ORDER_TYPES.PIZZA) { total += orders[i].pizzas; } } return total; } Number of Keys There are a few approaches to obtaining every key in an object. To iterate across all properties, we can use the in operator:\nconst object = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 } for(let key in object) { console.log(key); } After 3 iterations this will log a, b and c which are the keys of object. We can use some methods on object that will return an array of that data.\nconst object = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 } console.log( Object.keys(object) ); // [\u0026#39;a\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;b\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;c\u0026#39;] console.log( Object.values(object) ); // [1, 2, 3] Example: Given an object, find the number of keys inside the object. Return this number.\nfunction numberOfKeys(object) { return Object.keys(object).length; } Edit Object Values We can also edit values in an object.\nconst person = { name: \u0026#34;Sohan\u0026#34;, age: 21 } person.name = \u0026#34;Rohan\u0026#34;; person[\u0026#34;age\u0026#34;] = 40; console.log( person.name ); // Rohan console.log( person.age ); // 40 In retrieval, we can use the . or [] notation. We can also remove keys completly.\nconst person = { name: \u0026#34;Tom\u0026#34; } delete person.name; console.log( person.name ); // undefined Modify Object In JavaScript, objects are passed by reference. We can write functions to modify objects.\nfunction modify(object) { object.message = \u0026#34;Hello World\u0026#34;; } Let\u0026rsquo;s create an object and pass it to the above function:\nconst store = { name: \u0026#34;Star Eleven\u0026#34; } modify(store); console.log(store.message); // Hello World The object argument within the modify method is referencing the same memory as the store. Passing by reference is defined as this.\nThe object gets updated everywhere it is referenced when it is updated using the modify function.\nConclusion Ending with an extra bit of information about JavaScript\u0026hellip;\nA JavaScript object is a state-and-behaviour-containing entity (properties and method). Examples include a car, pen, bicycle, chair, glass, keyboard, and monitor. JavaScript is an object-based language. In JavaScript, everything is an object. JavaScript relies on templates rather than classes. To obtain the object in this case, no class is created. But we deliberately make objects.\nIt is always a good idea to be careful about modifying objects directly! The function is modifying something outside of its scope, potentially leading to unexpected consequences!\nToday I learned about Objects in JavaScript.\nIf You ❤️ My Content!

Let\u0026rsquo;s learn together!🫱🏼‍🫲🏼\nThis Article is a part of the JavaScript Fundamentals series.\nArrays In JavaScript, we use arrays to store a list of elements. An array starts with an open square bracket [ and ends with a closed square bracket ]. The elements inside the array are separated by a comma ,.\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]; const booleans = [true, false, true]; const strings = [\u0026#34;happy\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;laugh\u0026#34;]; Arrays are mutable means they can be changed. In JavaScript, arrays are objects and can hold multiple values under a single name. Arrays can be stored under arrays, referred to as a nested array.\nconst nested = [[2, 3, [2, 3]], 3]; While we are iterating over an array, we can keep a running value. We might do this for a variety of reasons. If we wanted to determine the average of several numbers.👇🏼\nconst result = average([80,90,98,100]); console.log( result ); // 92 Example: Given an array, find the sum of all even values inside the array and return it.\nfunction sumEven(array) { let sum = 0; for(let i = 0; i \u0026lt; array.length; i++){ if(array[i] % 2 === 0){ sum = sum + array[i] } } return sum; } Array Indexing Arrays have zero-based indexes just like strings. This means that the first element in the array is at the index 0, then 1:\nconst element = array[0]; Example: Complete the function hasOne which takes in an array of numbers. Return true if any of the numbers in the array are 1. Return false if not.\nfunction hasOne(array) { for(let i=0; i\u0026lt;array.length; i++){ if(array[i] === 1){ return true; } } return false; } Return New Array When formulating a function to filter an array, we can make a fresh array and insert the elements there whenever they meet our condition.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s imagine we wish to limit the numbers that an array returns to those that are bigger than 4:\nfunction greaterThanFour(array) { const newArray = []; for(let i = 0; i \u0026lt; array.length; i++) { const element = array[i]; // is this element greater than 4? if(element \u0026gt; 4) { // yes, push this element on our array newArray.push(element); } } return newArray; } Here, we\u0026rsquo;re making a new array and adding elements from the array to it only if they are greater than 4 to our newArray. The new array is then returned. push method adds new elements to the array.\nExample: Write a function that will take an array of numbers and return a new array that only contains unique numbers.\nfunction unique(array) { let newArray = []; for(let i = 0; i \u0026lt; array.length; i++) { const element = array[i]; if (newArray.indexOf(element) === -1) { // indexOf method was learned in previous tutorial newArray.push(element); } } return newArray; } Modify Array Values Using square brackets like array[0], we have learned how to read values from arrays. Similarly, we can use the assignment operator = to assign new values to those places.\nconst array = [1,2,3]; array[0] = 6; console.log(array); // [6,2,3] Example: Complete the addOne function to add 1 to every element within the array. Since we are modifying the array directly do not return it.\nfunction addOne(array) { for(let i = 0; i \u0026lt; array.length; i++) { array[i]++; } } Modify Array Let\u0026rsquo;s modify an array to filter it! splice method is used for removing elements from an array. Let\u0026rsquo;s use splice to remove elements that are greater than 1:\nconst array = [1,2,3]; for(let i = 0; i \u0026lt; array.length; i++) { if(array[i] \u0026gt; 1) { array.splice(i, 1); } } console.log(array); // [1, 3] // This is a Bug🐛 You must be wondering, why console.log showing 1 and 3 even after splicing elements greater than 1. Let\u0026rsquo;s see:\nIteration 1: The index points at the element 1. We do not splice 1 because it is not greater than 1. Works fine! i=0\nIteration 2: We find that 2 is greater than 1 so we splice at index 1. Works fine! i=1\nFinal Iteration: Array length is 2 and i=2. Loop condition is that i \u0026lt; array.length, so there are no further iterations at this point. We never removed 3!\nFix🔥 By counting backwards.\nconst array = [1,2,3]; for(let i = array.length - 1; i \u0026gt;= 0; i--) { if(array[i] \u0026gt; 1) { array.splice(i, 1); } } console.log(array); // [1] Iteration 1: Starting from end, we remove 3 because it is greater than 1 . Works fine! i=2\nIteration 2: Let\u0026rsquo;s move the index i to 1 . 2 will be removed by splicing at index 1 . Works fine! i=1\nFinal Iteration: 1 is not greater than 1, so we do not splice it. We are left with [1] in our array, as expected!\nConclusion Ending with an extra bit of information about JavaScript functions\u0026hellip;\nJavaScript does not care if we modify a value inside the data structure when the word const is used with an object or an array. Arrays are objects, so you may also include arrays while discussing an object\u0026rsquo;s characteristics.\nToday I learned about Arrays in JavaScript.\nIf You ❤️ My Content!

We learned how to retrieve characters by using the .length property and [].\nSo how can we loop over strings using these?\nconst string = \u0026#34;Hello\u0026#34;; for(let i = 0; i \u0026lt; string.length; i++) { console.log(string[i]); } It will log: H, e, l, l, o in that order after each iteration.\nExample: Complete the function isAllX to determine if the entire string is made of lower-case x or upper-case X. Return true if they are, false if not.\nfunction isAllX(string) { for(let i = 0; i \u0026lt; string.length; i++){ if(string[i].toLowerCase() !== \u0026#34;x\u0026#34;){ return false; } } return true; } Index Of In the previous section, we learned to look up a character by index. Now, is the time to find the index of a specific string.\nindexOf method is used to find the first index of a string.\n\u0026#34;Hello\u0026#34;.indexOf(\u0026#34;e\u0026#34;); // 1 \u0026#34;abc\u0026#34;.indexOf(\u0026#34;q\u0026#34;); // -1 \u0026#34;happy man dance\u0026#34;.indexOf(\u0026#34;man\u0026#34;); // 6 Both single characters and entire strings can be searched for in the index! indexOf will return -1 if the index could not be located.\nExample: In the string argument find the index of the first lowercase \u0026ldquo;x\u0026rdquo; and return it.\nfunction findFirstX(string) { return string.indexOf(\u0026#39;x\u0026#39;); } Slicing Strings We have another string method slice!\nSlice accepts two parameters: a start index and an end index. The resulting string is a sliced string between those two indexes, except for the character at the end index.\n\u0026#34;An apple\u0026#34;.slice(0,2); // An \u0026#34;The 20 Jokers\u0026#34;.slice(4,8); // 20 J If the last index is not provided, slice will continue until the end of the string:\n\u0026#34;Please Slice Me\u0026#34;.slice(7); // Slice Me We can also use negative arguments to slice strings starting from the end of the string!\n\u0026#34;the apple\u0026#34;.slice(-5); // apple \u0026#34;the apple\u0026#34;.slice(-5, -1); // appl Example: Let\u0026rsquo;s find the longer half of the string before and after the x! First, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to find the lower-case x. Once you\u0026rsquo;ve found the x, split the string in half. The first half will be the string before the x, the second half will be the string after the x.\nTake the longer string and return it!\n// split the string at the first occurrence of x // return the larger of the two resulting strings // i.e. HappyxDeveloper =\u0026gt; Developer function splitAtX(string) { const index = string.indexOf(\u0026#39;x\u0026#39;); const a = string.slice(0,index); const b = string.slice(index+1); return (a.length \u0026gt; b.length) ? a : b; } Conclusion Ending with an extra bit of information about JavaScript functions\u0026hellip;\nOn strings, there is a lastIndexOf method as well.

Let\u0026rsquo;s learn together!🫱🏼‍🫲🏼\nThis Article is a part of the JavaScript Fundamentals series.\nComparing Strings String comparison is actually very simple! The comparison operators ===, \u0026lt; and \u0026gt; that we studied in earlier lectures can be used.\nFor ===, we may compare the strings case-sensitively to see if they are identical:\nconsole.log( \u0026#39;a\u0026#39; === \u0026#39;a\u0026#39; ); // true console.log( \u0026#39;a\u0026#39; === \u0026#39;A\u0026#39; ); // false console.log( \u0026#39;a\u0026#39; === \u0026#39;a \u0026#39; ); // false ------Because the comparison is case-sensitive and requires exact equality, including whitespace. Looking up Characters Characters in strings can be looked up by index in JavaScript. Square brackets [] or charAt are the two methods available for doing this.\n\u0026#34;Hello\u0026#34;.charAt(1); // e \u0026#34;Hello\u0026#34;[1]; // e // we are looking up the character at the 1 index, which turns out to be the character e. Indexing:\nH - 0\ne - 1\nl - 2\nl - 3\no - 4\nZero-based indexing is used for strings. This indicates that the index of the first character is 0, and it increases by 1 for each additional character.\nExample: Complete the startsWithX function to determine if the first character of the string argument is the lower-case x. If the first character is x return true. If not, return false.\nfunction startsWithX(string) { if(string[0] === \u0026#34;x\u0026#34;) { return true; } return false; } Character Casing When working with strings, we frequently prefer to ignore the character casing. Whether it is an upper-case \u0026ldquo;X\u0026rdquo; or lower-case \u0026ldquo;x,\u0026rdquo; we are looking for \u0026ldquo;x\u0026rdquo;.\nManipulating a string\u0026rsquo;s case can be done in two simple ways:\nconsole.log( \u0026#34;Hello\u0026#34;.toLowerCase() );// hello console.log( \u0026#34;Hello\u0026#34;.toUpperCase() ); // HELLO Either of the following can be used to determine whether a string included the word \u0026quot;hello\u0026quot; regardless of its case:\nconsole.log( \u0026#34;Hello\u0026#34;.toUpperCase() === \u0026#34;HELLO\u0026#34; ); // true console.log( \u0026#34;Hello\u0026#34;.toLowerCase() === \u0026#34;hello\u0026#34; ); // true Example: Let\u0026rsquo;s update our startsWithX(from previous example) function to return true for an upper-case X as well as a lower-case x.\nfunction startsWithX(string) { if(string[0].toLowerCase() === \u0026#34;x\u0026#34;) { return true; } return false; } String Length Strings have an important feature called length. By using this feature, we can quickly determine how many characters are contained in a string:\nconsole.log( \u0026#34;a\u0026#34;.length ); // 1 console.log( \u0026#34;Hello\u0026#34;.length ); // 5 Example: Complete the endsWithX function by detecting if the last character in the string is a lower-case x or an upper-case X. Return true if it is, false if not.\nNote: The length value will be 1 greater than the last character index because the character indexing is 0 based.\nfunction endsWithX(string) { if(string[string.length - 1].toLowerCase() === \u0026#34;x\u0026#34;) { return true; } return false; } Conclusion Ending with an extra bit of information about JavaScript functions\u0026hellip;\nStrings in JavaScript allow us to store text that includes characters, integers, and Unicode and is immutable. Additionally, there are numerous built-in functions in JavaScript for creating and manipulating strings in different ways.\nToday I learned about String Manipulation in JavaScript.\nIf You ❤️ My Content!

Before the statement is carried out, the condition is assessed.\nwhile(b \u0026gt; 7) { // do something } We are just stating that if a condition is true, this statement shall be carried out till it is not.👇🏼\nExample: Complete the top double function to find the largest double for the value that is below the top.\nfunction topDouble(value, top) { while (value \u0026lt; top) { value = value*2; } return value/2; } Break Statement We will exit the loop once break is hit. Even when the condition is true, there is still a possibility to exit the loop thanks to the break statement.\nwhile(true) { if(a \u0026gt; 5) { // exit the loop break; } } Questions for Practise Given an integer value num, determine if it is even. If it is even, return true. Return false otherwise.\nfunction isEven(num) { if (num % 2 === 0){ return true; } } // or function isEven(num) { return num % 2 === 0; } The function smallerNumber will be given two unequal numbers: num1 and num2.

Let\u0026rsquo;s learn together!🫱🏼‍🫲🏼\nThis Article is a part of the JavaScript Fundamentals series.\nLoops Loops provide a quick and simple way to repeat an action. Programmers take advantage of this speed by creating scripts that do a task repeatedly until a predetermined condition is satisfied.\nIn pseudocode this might look a little like this:\nwhile we have book read book while we have pages in this book read page while we have words on the page read word For Loop A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.\nSummation of numbers example: Let\u0026rsquo;s think about how to repeatedly add the digits 1, 2, 3, and 4: The first step is to add 1 to a sum. Then we go to 2, add this to the total, and so on until we get to 4. An iteration occurs each time we add to the total. When the value is more than 4, we iterate until we reach our exit condition.\nlet sum = 0; for(let i = 1; i \u0026lt;= 4; i++) { sum = sum + i; } The for loop can be broken down into the initialization, condition, update and statement: Compare 👇🏼with👆🏼\nfor ([initialization]; [condition]; [update]) { statement } The Initialization is run once at the beginning of the loop. The Condition is checked before each iteration. The Update is run at the end of each iteration. The Statement is run as long as the Condition is true.\nFactorial of numbers example: In mathematics, a factorial is often denoted with an exclamation mark !. The sum of all positive integers greater than 0 up to and including the factorial number n is known as a factorial.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s take a look at a few examples of factorials:\n4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24\n3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6\n2! = 2 * 1 = 2\nExample: Taking in some integer value n, find the factorial for that number and return it.\nfunction factorial(n){ let result = 1; for (let i = 1; i \u0026lt;= n; i++){ result = result * i; // or result *= i; } return result; } Strings in loops example: Let\u0026rsquo;s add some exclamation marks to \u0026quot;Hello World\u0026quot;!\nlet str = \u0026#34;Hello World\u0026#34;; for(let i = 1; i \u0026lt;= 3; i++) { str += \u0026#34;!\u0026#34;; } console.log(str); // Hello World!!! Example: Let\u0026rsquo;s create a function scream which will take in a value n and return a string with the letter \u0026ldquo;a\u0026rdquo; repeated that many times like scream(5); // \u0026quot;aaaaa\u0026quot;\nfunction scream(n) { let str = \u0026#34;\u0026#34;; let i = 1; for (let i = 1; i\u0026lt;=n; i++){ str += \u0026#34;a\u0026#34; } return str; } Modulus Operator % operator is called the modulus operator. It will tell us the remainder of a division. When you divide 9 by 2 you get. Or 4 with a remainder of 1. The expression 9 % 2 evaluates to that remainder: 1\nLet\u0026rsquo;s take a look at a few examples:\nconsole.log(8 % 3) // 2 console.log(9 % 2) // 1 console.log(7 % 4) // 3 Example: Let\u0026rsquo;s modify our function to return a scream alternating between lower and capital case, like these:\nconsole.log( scream(4) ); // aAaA console.log( scream(9) ); // aAaAaAaAa\nfunction scream(n) { let str = \u0026#34;\u0026#34;; for (let i = 1; i \u0026lt;= n; i++) { const remainder = i % 2; const isEven = remainder === 0; if (isEven) { str += \u0026#34;A\u0026#34;; } else { str += \u0026#34;a\u0026#34;; } } return str; } Conclusion Ending with an extra bit of information about JavaScript functions\u0026hellip;\nAt the beginning of the for loop, the Initialization is once executed. Each iteration begins with a check of the Condition. The Statement will be executed if the expression evaluates to true. If it\u0026rsquo;s untrue, the statement won\u0026rsquo;t execute. Each iteration ends with the Update being executed. For the subsequent execution of the Statement, it may update a variable. As long as the Condition is true, the Statement is then executed. The actual work of the loop is completed here.\nToday I learned about For Loop, Modulus Operator in JavaScript.\nIf You ❤️ My Content!

You will also often see console.log used in code examples:\nlet a = 22; a = a + 10; console.log(a); // 32; Conditionals Conditional statements control behaviour in JavaScript and determine whether or not pieces of code can run.\nif Statement\nUse of if when needing to branch based on a condition:\nif(1 === 1) { console.log( \u0026#34;Yes, it\u0026#39;s true!\u0026#34; ); } In the above line, 1 === 1 is the condition. The === operator referred to as the strict equality operator. It compares two values and evaluates them to be true if they are equal.\nExample: Let\u0026rsquo;s complete the isEqual function! If a is equal to b return true.\nfunction isEqual(a, b) { return(a===b); } !== or Is Not Equal referred to as a strict inequality operator. This operator will evaluate to true if the two values are not equal.\nconsole.log( 1 !== 2 ); // true console.log( 2 !== 2 ); // false console.log( 3 !== 2 ); // true Example: Let\u0026rsquo;s complete the isNotEqual function!

If a is not equal to b return true. Otherwise, return false.\nfunction greater(first, last) { if (first \u0026gt; last){ return first; } if (last \u0026gt; first) { return last; } } Let\u0026rsquo;s take a look at two new operators, greater than \u0026gt; and less than \u0026lt; operators!

To get a random number we can call the Math.random function.\nconst myRandomNumber = Math.random(); The above line will return some number between 0 and 1 (not including 1). Math.random can also be used to generate random numbers between the range.\nExample: Inside getRandom, get a random number from the Math.random() function. Then, return that number!👇🏼\nfunction getRandom() { return Math.random(); } A random number between 0 and 100 could be created by simply multiplying the output:\n// randomNumber will be between 0 and 100 const randomNumber = Math.random() * 100; We could multiply and then add to get a random number between 15 and 100:\n// randomNumber will be between 15 and 100 const randomNumber = (Math.random() * 85) + 15; Math.floor Math.floor takes arguments.\nconst two = Math.floor(2.2598223); Math.floor function will take 2.2598223 and return 2. A number will be rounded to the nearest integer using this function. For instance, if the input was 2.9999, the method would round it to 2.\nExample: Take the argument x and use Math.floor to turn it into an integer without the values after the decimal place. Once you have this floored value, return it!\nfunction getFloor(x) { return Math.floor(x); } Conclusion Ending with an extra bit of information about JavaScript functions\u0026hellip;\nThe JavaScript Math object allows us to perform mathematical tasks on numbers.

These are the variables that are defined in the function declaration.\nIf we were to call this function with two values: 2 and 4\naddNumbers(2, 4); The values 2 and 4 would be considered arguments. Arguments are the data supplied to the function to get filled into parameters.\nOperators JavaScript operators are symbols that are used to perform operations on operands.

JavaScript powers the contemporary web, your contemporary servers, and even the development environments on our computers. Whether it is web 2.0 or web 3.0, JavaScript is used everywhere.\nNumber Variable A JavaScript variable is nothing more than a name for a storage area. In JavaScript, there are two different sorts of variables: local variables and global variables. When declaring a JavaScript variable, there are several guidelines (also known as identifiers).\nThe name must begin with an alphabetical letter (from A to Z), an underscore (_), or a dollar sign ($).\nThe first letter can be followed by any number from 0 to 9, such as the value 1.\nJavaScript variables are case-sensitive; for instance, the variables x and X are distinct.\nJavaScript variables are written in lowerCamelCase. for example const isLoggedIn = true;\nJavaScript cares about variables in one word (not separated by space).\nWe store values in something called a variable.\nconst a = 5\nIn the above code, a is the variable. Number 5 is the value to be stored in a and const is a keyword used to declare a as a constant value in JavaScript.\nMultiple Variables JavaScript programs run line by line, the line const a = 5 is called a statement. In JavaScript, statements should end with ; (semi-colon). In some cases, JavaScript automatically inserts semi-colons in a statement. The best practice is to insert ; at every statement end.\nWe can create another variable to store the value of the previous variable.\nconst a = 5;\nconst b = a;\nBoth a and b will store the value 5.\nBooleans A JavaScript Boolean represents one of two values: true or false.\nconst loggedIn = false;\nIf a user is logged in the above line, the false indicated that they are not.\nWe can also store boolean values inside variables. If we have to store true in one variable and false in another variable, then:\ncont a = false;\nconst b = true;\nQuotes Both single ' ' and double \u0026quot; \u0026quot; quotes can be used when declaring JavaScript strings.\nHere, we used double quotes so we could use a single quote inside the message:\nconst message = \u0026quot;Hello, hope you are doing fine!\u0026quot; ;\nIf we needed to use double quotes:\nconst message = 'Then he said, \u0026quot;Hey, are you coming home?\u0026quot;';\nIf we needed to use a double quote inside double quote string, we can use a backslash \\ as an escape character:\nconst message = \u0026quot;This is double-quote \\\u0026quot; inside double-quotes\u0026quot;;\nStrings Strings in JavaScript are used to store and modify text. A string in JavaScript is zero or more characters enclosed in quotes.\nStrings are nothing but a bunch of characters (a, b, c) put together.\nIn JavaScript, there are three ways to define a string. first two of them are:\nconst a = \u0026quot;Hello!\u0026quot;;\nHere, myName and anotherName uses two different types of quotes, single and double. We can use either one or inside of each other.\nconst myName = 'Anand';\nconst anotherName = \u0026quot;Vishal\u0026quot;;\nNow look at the third method to declare strings:\nconst helloMessage = `Hello ${myName}, my name is ${anothername}!`;\nHere, helloMessage variable uses backticks ` . With backticks, we can add values inside the strings. The ${variable} is about this. In the above line of code, we are taking value from myName and anotherName and placing them into strings. The variable helloMessage now contains \u0026quot;Hello Anand, my name is Vishal!\u0026quot;\nConclusion Ending with an extra bit of information about JavaScript\u0026hellip;\nJavaScript also uses upper snake case sometimes like const SERVER_KEY_VALUE = \u0026quot;abcdefg\u0026quot;; This casing is typically reserved for environment variables or values that are needed to be determined before code executions. Like, if you have some secret key that you want to store on the server but not on the local machine, then You might keep that variable tucked away on the server in an environment variable that will require permissions to access or change. These are the types of variables we\u0026rsquo;ll often see with this casing.\nToday I learned about Number variables, multiple variables, booleans, quotes and strings in JavaScript.\nIf You ❤️ My Content!

I am going to share the step-by-step method I followed while building a blog website using a static site generator Hugo and deploying it to Netlify. I encountered some small errors during the process, I am gonna entertain those as well. Let\u0026rsquo;s get started.\nAs I am using windows, commands may be different, follow official docs while building your own website using Hugo. Also, I am running all commands on git bash.\nStep 1 Create any folder on Desktop and open git bash. Now time to install hugo.\nchoco install hugo -confirm Or if you need the “extended” Sass/SCSS version: for some supported theme. Better install it from cmd by running it as administrator.\nchoco install hugo-extended -confirm Step 2 Now it\u0026rsquo;s time to create a new website and add a cool theme to it. You can choose any theme from the Hugo theme library. Run below commands.\n// Choose your site name in place of blognerd\rhugo new site blognerd The above will create a new Hugo site in a folder named blognerd.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s time to add theme to the site. See theme library for a list of themes to consider. I am using Beautiful Hugo theme.\ncd blognerd\rgit init You can access GitHub repo of themes by just clicking download button on theme page as you can see in above picture. Now, download the theme from GitHub and add it to site\u0026rsquo;s theme directory.\ngit submodule add https://github.com/halogenica/beautifulhugo.git themes/beautifulhugo Now, add the theme to the site configuration:\necho theme = \\\u0026#34;beautifulhugo\\\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; config.toml Step 3 It\u0026rsquo;s time to add some contents to the newly created site. You can also add them manually but I am creating this using commands.\nhugo new posts/my-first-post.md Now open the whole folder in any code editor, I am using VS Code and edit your post as you wish. You can see the screenshot of mine editor below for reference of posts files.\nAbove contents may be different for the theme you are using. I am going to add one of my article contents to this post for example, see below screenshot. You can edit metadata between --- accordingly.\nStep 4 Now, is the time to test the site we created by running Hugo server.\nhugo server -D //run only this command Start building sites …\rhugo v0.105.0-0e3b42b4a9bdeb4d866210819fc6ddcf51582ffa+extended windows/amd64 BuildDate=2022-10-28T12:29:05Z VendorInfo=gohugoio\r| EN\r-------------------+------\rPages | 10\rPaginator pages | 0\rNon-page files | 0\rStatic files | 184\rProcessed images | 0\rAliases | 2\rSitemaps | 1\rCleaned | 0\rBuilt in 4884 ms You can check live view on http://localhost:1313/\nhere\u0026rsquo;s mine live view\u0026hellip; Step 5 It\u0026rsquo;s time to give final touch to the newly created site. You can customize theme or configure site by opening up config.toml in a text editor and edit accordingly. In this theme I took help from their GitHub readme.\nNow, time to build static site. Run below command after closing hugo server by pressing Ctrl+c\nhugo -D //run only this command\rStart building sites …\rhugo v0.105.0-0e3b42b4a9bdeb4d866210819fc6ddcf51582ffa+extended windows/amd64 BuildDate=2022-10-28T12:29:05Z VendorInfo=gohugoio\r| EN\r-------------------+------\rPages | 16\rPaginator pages | 0\rNon-page files | 0\rStatic files | 184\rProcessed images | 0\rAliases | 5\rSitemaps | 1\rCleaned | 0\rTotal in 763 ms Step 6 Everything is now set. You can add more blog contents or customize the site according to your requirement. Now the final work is to deploy it to Netlify.\nI have Netlify CLI installed so I am going to the final step, You can install it by going to Netlify official docs and login to your account.\nAfter installing, run following commands:\nnetlify dev It will open Netlify live server on http://localhost:8888. After checking everything on your site, close netlify server by pressing Ctrl+c. Time to deploy..\nnetlify deploy //run only this command This folder isn\u0026#39;t linked to a site yet\r? What would you like to do? (Use arrow keys)\r\u0026gt; Link this directory to an existing site\r+ Create \u0026amp; configure a new site Follow the instruction and select (.) directory. Now deploy production.\nnetlify deploy --prod\r// select public directory Hurray! Now you can access your live website with Netlify domain from Netlify dashboard.

It is a three-month-long Open-Source Program conducted by the GirlScript Foundation for beginners. This year I am selected as project admin for the program. (GSSOC'22)\nIn this article, I am going to share my experiences from being a contributor in an open-source program to the project admin \u0026amp; mentor of one.\nHow I started? My first open-source contribution was to a friend\u0026rsquo;s repository. After doing some small contributions I came to know about GSSoC program and I took part in it. This was the first big contribution from my side to any open source project. Before that, I had some experience contributing to EbookFoundation / free-programming-books. From that, I learned to communicate over issues and to make pull requests properly. This previous work helped me a lot during GirlScript Summer of Code.\nWhat I Learned? Successful contributions during the program definitely acted as a confidence booster for me. Now, I was more confident to work on any open-source project. While contributing I went through some issues and pull requests where project maintainers were discussing things and I tried to understand their workflow, and how they manage things.\nAfter some time, I decided to take part as a project admin in an open-source program. Hacktoberfest was the best time to do so because many newbies were going to start their open source contributions in the month of October.\nWhat Next? I had created a repository to host small JavaScript projects. It was for personal use first but after the decision of participating as a project admin, I created a GitHub organization ZeroOctave and added the same repository inside that. Hacktoberfest was going to start so I thought of taking my chances and as expected some good contributions were added to the repository. I was enjoying my role as a maintainer while guiding contributors for the contribution to my repository.\nJust after Hacktoberfest, some more open-source programs were going to start so I applied with my repository and got accepted in two of them. Those programs were Infinite Clone Conspiracy \u0026amp; DWoC'21. These programs were not big enough to attract many contributors but still some good projects were added to our repository and some new members also joined the GitHub organization.\nGSSoC! GSSoC stands for Google GirlScript Summer of Code. As I mentioned earlier, GSSoC'21 acted as the starting step for my open source journey. After 1 year when another version of GSSoC came back, I decided to participate in my project this time. I filled out the registration form with my organization and project details and got selected as project admin. It\u0026rsquo;s a 3-month long program currently going on, many new contributions are coming into our organization repository. ZeroOctave Javascript Projects is our project repository that is the part of GSSoC'22. Till now 200+ issues created and 200+ pull requests merged.\nWhile doing my work as project admin and coordinating with my project maintainers, I am also focused on enhancing my tech skills. So that I can contribute to some good open-source projects out there.\nInvitation For You! If you are a beginner, you are welcome to contribute to our organization. If you are an active open source contributor or maintainer, you are welcome to join ZeroOctave.

In the software industry, Open Source projects are widely regarded now. How can recruiters know that the abilities you claim to have are truly the skills you have? When you\u0026rsquo;re a fresher with no professional experience open-source contributions come in useful. Without any prior industry expertise, GitHub allows you to exhibit your work. As a result, it\u0026rsquo;s important to make GitHub Profile stand out and present the best version of yourself.\nIn this article, I am shedding light on tips to Make Your GitHub Profile Standout To Attract Better Opportunities.\nIntroduction! The above screenshot is of my GitHub profile. I have mentioned my bio in a detailed manner, including contribution graphs, badges, tech stack, proper name, username, profile picture, social handles, and my side hustles. You can also create your GitHub profile like mine or even better. Isn\u0026rsquo;t my profile more detailed and attractive than resume? I hope after seeing the above screenshot you also want to make your GitHub profile stand out. Let\u0026rsquo;s get started!\nFoundation Stone As you know already, the repository is the main feature of GitHub where every project, content, code is stored properly.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s start by creating a special repository after signing in to your GitHub account. This repository name must be same as your GitHub username.\nThis is a ✨special ✨ repository that you can use to add a README.md to your GitHub profile. Make sure it’s public and initialize it with a README or create a README.md file inside this repository to get started.\nMarkdown will be used to add contents and details in README file.

They are just starting their open-source journey and making mistakes. In the beginning, making mistakes is not a bad thing. But, correctly contributing to open-source projects is also very important.\nIn this article, I am going to discuss some tips on - How Not to contribute to Open-Source on GitHub.\nUnderstanding Projects Understanding of project like how folders are arranged? how files are linked? which tech stack is used? is the most important thing before raising an issue or making a pull request in any project on GitHub.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t make pull requests or raise issues without reading contributing guidelines of any projects. Always read the README.md file of projects where everything related to the project is written most of the time. Also, clone the project in your machine and go through every file once to understand its working.\nRaising Issue If you want to solve any bug or to contribute some lines of code to a project then you have to raise an issue. But always check the previous issues raised by anyone else to confirm, if anyone else is working or described the same issue that you gonna solve.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t raise 1 or 2-word issue, that doesn\u0026rsquo;t make sense to anyone else. Always remember to add proper details/context in the issue because the issue is like a chain of conversation related to changes you or anyone else wants to make in the project. Write a proper description and proper title to the issue also add screenshots, links, information, or an approach to solve that issue to proper understanding. Make issues such that project maintainers or contributors understand your views and suggestions quickly.\n✅Do this ❌Don\u0026rsquo;t do this Making Pull Request Your PR should do one thing. Always make a pull request for one part or section so that it would be easier for reviewers and maintainers to merge your pull request. If you are solving multiple issues in a project then open multiple PRs.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t make multiple PRs in one, this is confusing sometimes and also delayed the merging process. Let\u0026rsquo;s assume you are making a PR for a new feature in the project and you also found a bug related to a different part of the same project. Don\u0026rsquo;t fix that bug in the same PR. Because sometimes the other changes that gonna add value to the project get delayed due to multiple PRs in one. Make PRs small and on point, which will help your pull request getting merged easily.\nDon’t open a PR like this:\nFixes bug #343 Adds new linting rules Includes feature #466 Attaching screenshots or some information related to your changes in the PR description is also very good practice. This will help the maintainer or reviewer to differentiate between changes.\n✅Do this\n❌Don\u0026rsquo;t do this\nApprovals and Dead PRs Don\u0026rsquo;t start working on any project before the maintainer gives you a go-ahead or assigned that issue to you. Don\u0026rsquo;t open pull requests immediately. Wait for the maintainers approval\nIf the issue is already open and not assigned to anyone, ask maintainers if you can work on that. Start work on your PR. Don\u0026rsquo;t ask maintainers to assign you an issue that is already assigned to someone else. Sometimes you get confused during working on PR maybe you lost interest or whatever reasons please don\u0026rsquo;t leave that open PR as it is, make sure to close that dead PR. The maintainer may not want to close it because they don\u0026rsquo;t want to upset you. It neither looks good for the project nor to you. You can always reopen the Pull request if you want to work on that in the future.\nBe Meaningful Every contribution is valuable. If something is broken in the project like an important link is not working in the documentation that will be needed to be fixed. But if you just change an emoji from ⚡ to 🚀, this is not much valuable.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t break consistency.\nEvery time make sure to follow proper file order and directory to commit changes. Removing semicolons, adding spaces, or making text bold in the project that doesn\u0026rsquo;t prefer them. Hassling Maintainers To Merge When you create any pull request or issue I know you get excited. Maintainers will get a notification that you raised or crested. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to add additional comments and tag them. If it\u0026rsquo;s taking time, give them a friendly call in comments that will be fine.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t hassle them on DMs on Twitter, Discord, Linkedin, or any other socials by sending them links of your issue or PRs. They are getting notifications from projects they maintain and you are adding more notifications. This will create more confusion for maintainers. Remember, most of these people maintaining projects are from different time zones. Many of them are maintaining open-source project in addition of their work. Be patience! You can give them a friendly reminder after 1 week or such.\n✅Do this\n❌Don\u0026rsquo;t do this\nReferences Eddie Jaoude\nIf You ❤️ My Content!

How you can code something interesting and then view its fascinating outcomes. But Doing it in the right way is also very important. While scrolling YouTube I found a video where some developers and community leaders were sharing their tips about programming.\nIn this Article, I am going to share 20 Top Tips From The Coding Community\n1. Use Google The developers\u0026rsquo; best friend is Google. I don\u0026rsquo;t know who you are or how much experience you have, no one can remember everything. Learning how to google things itself is a required skill every developer should have. Finding resources to learn or to fix bugs google is going to help you with everything related to your coding journey. Googling is an Art! Learn it.\n2. Pick Tech You Like Choose something you like. JavaScript is trending now in web development, if you like it Great!. If you are not intrested in web development fine! choose App development or some other tech. just make sure to learn something you like.\n3. Learn \u0026amp; Code Always learn \u0026amp; code at the same time. This will help you to understand concepts properly. If you are learning something solve some questions related to the concepts.\n4. Support Other Learners If your classmates or someone is learning something or creating something. Help them with your knowledge, Support them. Supporting someone will going to help you to become a good developer. Talks about the things they did great, talk about the things they need to work upon. Don\u0026rsquo;t humiliate by saying every time: hey you are wrong! this sucks! that\u0026rsquo;s bad, Instead talk about it and explain the solution.\n5. Write Out Your problem Suppose you have a coding issue, when you write it out and started explaining it to someone you end up explaining it in your own brain. Sometimes You already figures out the answer before you even going to ask someone by seeing what you have written. So write out your problems before code.\n6. Build \u0026amp; Practice If you are learning to code, practice is the most important thing to follow across the learning period. Don\u0026rsquo;t stuck in tutorial hell. Learn and practice to get better. Suppose you are learning web development, create mini-projects after clearing every concept, and implement it.\n7. Go At Your Own Pace This is not a competition. If it takes you a long time to understand concepts, it\u0026rsquo;s OK. Don\u0026rsquo;t compare yourself with others, everyone\u0026rsquo;s mind is different. At the end of the day, the only thing matters are what you learned. Go Slowly! Believe in Yourself!\n8. Error Message/Bugs Error messages and bugs are your friends now. Get comfortable with these while coding, it\u0026rsquo;s a part of the job. It\u0026rsquo;s going to help you a lot.\n9. Take Small Breaks Always take small breaks between coding sessions, get up from the chair drink water. walk for 5 minutes, see outside the window, and get relaxed. this will boost your productivity.\n10. Dealing With Imposter Syndrome Remember that no one knows everything and you are not expected to know everything. So, admit when you don\u0026rsquo;t completely understand something so that others around you can help you and celebrates your win. No matter how big or small they are, when you look back at the time when you first started learning. You are going to see how far you came, Never give up.\n11. Fun Based Learning When you code something and going to deploy it remember programming should always be fun. Create small side projects to learn things. Maybe a small game you made helps you to understand the concept faster. when you start enjoying the coding process, you will be going to be a good developer.\n12. Timebox When You Are Stuck If you gonna struggle with a problem, give yourself some time like 30 minutes or 1 hour but in limit before going to ask someone or to take help. Neither ask early nor stuck for too long.\n13. Focus On Small Things Improve yourself every day, fix a time slot to code every day. like you decided to code for 3 hours daily, so follow this. Don\u0026rsquo;t miss these 3 hours. Coding daily will boost your confidence as well as problem-solving skills. These small things matter. Small things make huge differences. Assess your silly mistakes while doing code to improve yourself.\n14. Explore \u0026amp; Be Passionate Always keep exploring new things in the programming world and be passionate about what you are doing or learning. New things always keep coming, find and know about it, keep yourself updated with the latest tools and trends in the coding world. Mastering what you learn but keeping knowledge of changing tech is equally important.\n15. Real \u0026amp; Desired Projects Making small projects while learning is a good thing. But when it comes to jobs having a better side project will give you an edge over others. Just make a project which you want to see in this world, give it a try make your imagination real. Failing is OK, at least you should try.\n16. Find A Mentor and Work With Experienced Peoples Having a good mentor is all you need to grow in the industry or to come out of problems by following the right path. Mentors can guide you to what you need to learn and what not to.\nWorking with experienced people helps you to learn from their experiences. while working they can share some insights which will make your life easier in the coding world.\n17. Find Your Community Community is everything in this industry. Connecting with people of similar interests and fields is all you need to get better. Having in some good communities is the best thing you can do to grab opportunities and to take help and do help.\n18. Physical and Mental Health Staying fit is a huge challenge nowadays. Sitting on a chair for long durations while coding can make you unhealthy, so take proper care of your health. It\u0026rsquo;s most important. Exercise daily! Drink lots of water! Walk around the city! Eat healthily and use the proper desk setup for coding. Do meditation in the morning and wash your eyes with cold water thrice a day. Eyes are most exposed to bright desktop screens.\n19. Document And Share Experiences No matter what you learned or achieved, document your journey. Sometimes during your learning process, you got stuck but get the solution after some time. Do share it with the world by writing blogs or making videos. Your experiences gonna help others.\n20. Contribute To Open-Source Because most coders overlook open-source contributions, I\u0026rsquo;m writing this in the final section of this article. You\u0026rsquo;ve studied everything, but how will you use your knowledge to work on a vast codebase if you don\u0026rsquo;t understand how real-world projects work? It\u0026rsquo;s also critical to have a thorough understanding of real-world software and projects. Start contributing to open source to help you achieve your goals.\nSome Bonus Tips Learn In Public: Post your daily learning on Twitter or LinkedIn. This will help you as well as others. By doing this, you are making yourself more open to job opportunities. Use Stack Overflow: If You get stuck in coding problems and find solutions later share it there so that anyone facing the same issue in the future can take help from it.
