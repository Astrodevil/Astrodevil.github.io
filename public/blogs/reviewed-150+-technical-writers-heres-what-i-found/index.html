I was searching for a few good technical writers who could publish great blogs about AI/ML, web development tutorials, or even general articles. For this, I reviewed technical writers from Hashnode, Dev, Medium, other platforms, and many from the portfolios shared on my X post. Most were good writers, but their profiles lacked a few things as technical writers.\nIn this article, I’ll be sharing my findings from their portfolios so that you can make your profile better as a technical writer.\nThis article addresses beginners and writers eager to improve themselves as technical writers.\nCasual Writer or Technical Writer Many writers have published a few articles based on their learnings, but this doesn’t necessarily make them technical writers. These articles may be as brief as social media posts, raising doubts about whether the authors can produce substantial technical blogs. Being a technical writer means regularly publishing articles that cover a diverse range of topics in a well-explained and detailed manner.\nIt’s important to differentiate between those who write occasional technical briefs and dedicated technical writers who produce comprehensive and in-depth articles. While casual writers may create technically accurate content, their work often lacks the depth and detail required for true technical writing.\nThis distinction is crucial, as technical writing demands not only expertise but also the ability to convey complex information clearly in a professional or simple manner.\nDon’t write just for money, write if you love or care to contribute to the tech community as a writer.\nLack of Ownership I’ve observed that many writers don’t take full ownership of their work. Even though they have articles published on company blogs or platforms like freeCodeCamp, these pieces often don’t make it into their personal portfolios or websites.\nScattered links aren’t effective, even for established writers. It’s important to claim your content and make sure your name is prominently associated with it. Here are some steps to improve your ownership:\nTake Credit for Your Work: Make sure your name is on every article you write. If you’re publishing on third-party platforms, ask for a byline or include a headshot.\nUse a Professional Profile Picture: Adding a professional profile picture helps readers connect with you on a personal level.\nCentralize Your Work: Collect all your published articles in one place, such as a personal website or an online portfolio. This makes it easier for potential clients or employers to see the evidence of your work.\nBy taking these steps, you can better showcase your skills and accomplishments, making it easier for others to recognize and appreciate your work.\nTLDR Newsletter\rThis article is supported by TLDR Newsletter\nNo Personal Profiles Another significant gap I noticed is the absence of personal blogging profiles among many technical writers. While contributing to company blogs or external platforms can be valuable, having a personal blog that you control is essential for establishing your unique voice and showcasing your expertise.\nA personal blog allows you to:\nDemonstrate Expertise: Regularly publish content that highlights your knowledge and skills in technical writing.\nShowcase Work: Share detailed case studies, project overviews, and examples of your writing.\nBuild Authority: Establish yourself as a thought leader in your field by discussing industry trends, best practices, and innovative techniques.\nEngage with Community: Foster a community of peers, potential clients, and employers who can interact with your content, providing feedback and building professional relationships.\nEnhance SEO: Improve your visibility online through search engine optimization, making it easier for others to find and connect with you.\nInvesting in a personal blog can significantly enhance your career prospects and professional reputation, offering a platform that you fully control to present your best work and insights.\nLack of Branding Another significant gap is the lack of personal branding among many technical writers. Closely related to personal profiles, personal branding involves establishing a unique identity that sets you apart from others in your field. It entails consistently presenting yourself and your work in a way that reflects your values, expertise, and professional goals.\nEffective personal branding can help you:\nStand Out in a Crowded Market: Differentiate yourself from other technical writers by showcasing your unique skills and perspective.\nAttract More Opportunities: Gain visibility and appeal to potential clients, employers, and collaborators.\nCommand Higher Rates: Establish a reputation for quality and expertise, allowing you to charge premium rates for your services.\nBuilding a strong personal brand requires a strategic approach, including:\nA Professional Website: Create a central hub for your portfolio, services, and contact information.\nA Cohesive Social Media Presence: Maintain consistent and professional profiles across various platforms.\nRegular Audience Engagement: Share your insights through blogs, articles, or speaking engagements to demonstrate your knowledge and stay connected with your audience.\nInvesting in personal branding can significantly enhance your career prospects and professional reputation, positioning you as a leader in your field.\nfor eg; to see how branding helps, search “Astrodevil” on Google and let me know in the comments what you found.😅\nKeep this in mind:\n💡\rWhen applying for technical writing jobs, share a single link that includes all your live blog posts and articles. This makes it easier for employers to review your work.\r💡\rAlways share portfolios/profiles with live links to your blogs instead of PDF or GitHub files for better credibility.\r💡\rAvoid spamming DMs or links when seeking writing opportunities. Instead, create a good profile on one social media platform that aligns with your blogging profile.\r💡\rTechnical writers with personal blogs tend to attract more opportunities organically.\rConclusion Reviewing over 150 technical writers has been an enlightening experience, revealing key areas for improvement and growth. Whether you’re a casual writer or a dedicated technical writer, focusing on ownership, consistency, personal profiles, and branding can improve your work and enhance your career. By addressing these common mistakes, you can develop the skills and reputation needed to succeed in the competitive field of technical writing.\n","wordCount":"999","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1717295811734/308b81f2-9a98-4adc-be25-7feca5be19af.png?w=1600\u0026h=840\u0026fit=crop\u0026crop=entropy\u0026auto=compress,format\u0026format=webp","datePublished":"2024-06-02T08:25:05+05:30","dateModified":"2024-06-02T08:25:05+05:30","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Mr. Ånand"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://mranand.com/blogs/reviewed-150+-technical-writers-heres-what-i-found/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Mr. Ånand","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://mranand.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://mranand.com/ accesskey=h title="Mr. Ånand (Alt + H)">Mr. Ånand</a>
