In the software industry, Open Source projects are widely regarded now. How can recruiters know that the abilities you claim to have are truly the skills you have? When you&rsquo;re a fresher with no professional experience open-source contributions come in useful. Without any prior industry expertise, GitHub allows you to exhibit your work. As a result, it&rsquo;s important to make GitHub Profile stand out and present the best version of yourself.</p>
<p>In this article, I am shedding light on tips to <strong>Make Your GitHub Profile Standout To Attract Better Opportunities</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction!</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Astrodevil" target="_blank" class="highlight-line"><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1643986105138/0oFtVvL6rO.png" alt="screely-1643985124626.png"  />
</a></p>
<p>The above screenshot is of my GitHub profile. I have mentioned my bio in a detailed manner, including contribution graphs, badges, tech stack, proper name, username, profile picture, social handles, and my side hustles. You can also create your GitHub profile like mine or even better. Isn&rsquo;t my profile more detailed and attractive than resume? I hope after seeing the above screenshot you also want to make your GitHub profile stand out. <em>Let&rsquo;s get started!</em></p>
<h2 id="foundation-stone">Foundation Stone</h2>
<p>As you know already, the repository is the main feature of GitHub where every project, content, code is stored properly.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start by creating a special repository after signing in to your GitHub account. <strong>This repository name must be same as your GitHub username</strong>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1643985010957/IkhnHnKtE.png" alt="screely-1643984983985.png"  />
</p>
<p>This is a ✨special ✨ repository that you can use to add a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes" target="_blank" class="highlight-line">README.md</a> to your GitHub profile. Make sure it’s public and initialize it with a README or create a README.md file inside this repository to get started.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown" target="_blank" class="highlight-line">Markdown</a> will be used to add contents and details in <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes" target="_blank" class="highlight-line">README</a> file. Learn Markdown syntax from this <a href="https://github.com/Astrodevil/Open-Source-Gallery/blob/main/src/markdown-cheatsheet.pdf" target="_blank" class="highlight-line">cheetsheet</a>. README files are commonly used to write documentation for the project repositories.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to add contents in your profile README.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3 id="header">Header</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the header, you can add your name, greet message, photo or gif, or nothing according to your choice. I am using my profile-related codes, you can change accordingly.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code># Hi, I&#39;m Astrodevil &lt;img src=&#34;https://github.com/TheDudeThatCode/TheDudeThatCode/blob/master/Assets/Hi.gif&#34; width=&#34;29px&#34;&gt;
</code></pre><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1643988124430/yV3R85kVl.png" alt="screely-1643988107672.png"  />
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3 id="about">About</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the About section you can add your little introduction, What you are working on, What are your goals or something like that.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code># replace contents according to you.
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td valign=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
      🎓 I am currently pursuing my **Bachelor&#39;s in Computer Science Engineering**.
      🌱 I am currently learning **Java** and also interested in **Web Development**.
      🎯 My Goal is to Contribute to as many **open source project** as possible.
      ✨ I love to create different types of **contents**.
&lt;td &gt;

</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3 id="contribution-graph">Contribution Graph</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I have added a contribution graph banner to update daily activity from my GitHub profile. It&rsquo;s a nice way to showcase if you are active frequently and doing some contributions in projects. This graph is updating daily automatically.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code> # replace username with your own or change theme
![GitHub Activity Graph](https://activity-graph.herokuapp.com/graph?username=#your-username&amp;theme=dracula&amp;hide_border=true)
</code></pre><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1643999148850/TYksn6HXu.png" alt="screely-1643999127515.png"  />
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3 id="icons--badges">Icons &amp; Badges</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Adding <strong>social handles</strong> on GitHub profile is the best way to connect with peoples and transfer more audience towards your socials. You can use badges for that or icons. You can create badges from <a href="https://shields.io/" target="_blank" class="highlight-line">shields.io</a> and also use icons from <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/social-media" target="_blank" class="highlight-line">flaticon</a>. There are tons of site to find attractive icons. You can also add information about your tech stack and tools you are familiar with by using badges and icons.

</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3 id="stats-card">Stats Card</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Adding Stats cards to your GitHub page is another common profile enhancement. This is a simple method to display all of your GitHub statistics in a fun, visual way. You can also track your GitHub Streak.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code># replace username with your own or change theme
## Stats📈
&lt;p align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;

</p>
<p>These are the basic customization method that can make your GitHub profile stand out, I used my profile as an example to explain above. You can also add more customization in your GitHub profile README to make it detailed and attractive. <em>Let&rsquo;s see that in next section</em>.</p>
<h2 id="building">Building</h2>
<ul>
<li>You can also <strong>track your activity</strong> and showcase it on your profile README by using a GitHub Action Scripts. Just create <code>/.github/workflows/update-readme.yml</code> inside the repository and paste below code inside update-readme.yml file. This script updates activity every 30 minutes.</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>name: Update README

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: &#39;*/30 * * * *&#39;
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Update this repo&#39;s README with recent activity

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: jamesgeorge007/github-activity-readme@master
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
</code></pre><p>Add this block to README.md file where you want to showcase your recent activity</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>
&lt;!--START_SECTION:activity--&gt;
&lt;!--END_SECTION:activity--&gt;
</code></pre><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1644003241309/oKOBcwt09.png" alt="screely-1644003225209.png"  />
</p>
<ul>
<li>You can also add your <strong>blogs and side hustles</strong> on your profile README by manually adding it or automating the tasks by using GitHub Actions. Check this <a href="https://astrodevil.hashnode.dev/some-cool-github-actions-you-wont-believe-exists" target="_blank" class="highlight-line">article</a> to know more about helpful actions. You can impress recruiters by showcasing your awesome side hustles.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1644005000197/gFSVDnWjN.png" alt="screely-1644004991863.png"  />
</p>
<h2 id="final-touch">Final Touch</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t want to learn Markdown or don&rsquo;t have enough time to write from scratch. You can use <a href="https://rahuldkjain.github.io/gh-profile-readme-generator/" target="_blank" class="highlight-line">GitHub Profile README Generator</a>, <a href="https://gprm.itsvg.in/" target="_blank" class="highlight-line">GPRM</a> or <a href="https://readme.so/" target="_blank" class="highlight-line">readme generator</a> to create your profile README.</p>

<p>You can also take inspiration from other profiles by copy-pasting markdown codes in your README to customize accordingly. Here are the <a href="https://eddiehubcommunity.github.io/awesome-github-profiles/profiles" target="_blank" class="highlight-line">example profiles</a> you can take inspiration from.</p>

They are just starting their open-source journey and making mistakes. In the beginning, making mistakes is not a bad thing. But, correctly contributing to open-source projects is also very important.</p>
<p>In this article, I am going to discuss some tips on - <strong>How Not to contribute to Open-Source on GitHub</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-projects">Understanding Projects</h2>
<p>Understanding of project like how folders are arranged? how files are linked? which tech stack is used? is the most important thing before raising an issue or making a pull request in any project on GitHub.</p>
<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t</strong> make pull requests or raise issues without reading contributing guidelines of any projects. Always read the <a href="https://github.com/ZeroOctave/ZeroOctave-Javascript-Projects/blob/main/README.md" target="_blank" class="highlight-line">README.md</a> file of projects where everything related to the project is written most of the time. Also, clone the project in your machine and go through every file once to understand its working.</p>
<h2 id="raising-issue">Raising Issue</h2>
<p>If you want to solve any bug or to contribute some lines of code to a project then you have to raise an issue. But always check the previous issues raised by anyone else to confirm, if anyone else is working or described the same issue that you gonna solve.</p>
<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t</strong> raise 1 or 2-word issue, that doesn&rsquo;t make sense to anyone else. Always remember to add proper details/context in the issue because the issue is like a chain of conversation related to changes you or anyone else wants to make in the project. Write a proper description and proper title to the issue also add screenshots, links, information, or an approach to solve that issue to proper understanding. Make issues such that project maintainers or contributors understand your views and suggestions quickly.</p>
<p>✅<strong>Do this</strong>

<h2 id="making-pull-request">Making Pull Request</h2>
<p>Your PR should do one thing. Always make a pull request for one part or section so that it would be easier for reviewers and maintainers to merge your pull request. If you are solving multiple issues in a project then open multiple PRs.</p>
<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t</strong> make multiple PRs in one, this is confusing sometimes and also delayed the merging process. Let&rsquo;s assume you are making a PR for a new feature in the project and you also found a bug related to a different part of the same project. Don&rsquo;t fix that bug in the same PR. Because sometimes the other changes that gonna add value to the project get delayed due to multiple PRs in one. Make PRs small and on point, which will help your pull request getting merged easily.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t</strong> open a PR like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixes bug #343</li>
<li>Adds new linting rules</li>
<li>Includes feature #466</li>
</ul>
<p>Attaching screenshots or some information related to your changes in the PR description is also very good practice. This will help the maintainer or reviewer to differentiate between changes.</p>
<p>✅<strong>Do this</strong></p>

</p>
<h2 id="approvals-and-dead-prs">Approvals and Dead PRs</h2>
<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t</strong> start working on any project before the maintainer gives you a go-ahead or assigned that issue to you. Don&rsquo;t open pull requests immediately. Wait for the maintainers approval</p>
<ul>
<li>If the issue is already open and not assigned to anyone, ask maintainers if you can work on that.</li>
<li>Start work on your PR.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t ask maintainers to assign you an issue that is already assigned to someone else.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes you get confused during working on PR maybe you lost interest or whatever reasons please don&rsquo;t leave that open PR as it is, make sure to close that <strong>dead PR</strong>. The maintainer may not want to close it because they don&rsquo;t want to upset you. It neither looks good for the project nor to you. You can always reopen the Pull request if you want to work on that in the future.</p>
<h2 id="be-meaningful">Be Meaningful</h2>
<p>Every contribution is valuable. If something is broken in the project like an important link is not working in the documentation that will be needed to be fixed. But if you just change an emoji from ⚡ to 🚀, this is not much valuable.</p>
<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t</strong> break consistency.</p>
<ul>
<li>Every time make sure to follow proper file order and directory to commit changes.</li>
<li>Removing semicolons, adding spaces, or making text bold in the project that doesn&rsquo;t prefer them.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="hassling-maintainers-to-merge">Hassling Maintainers To Merge</h2>
<p>When you create any pull request or issue I know you get excited. Maintainers will get a notification that you raised or crested. You don&rsquo;t need to add additional comments and tag them. If it&rsquo;s taking time, give them a friendly call in comments that will be fine.</p>
<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t</strong> hassle them on DMs on Twitter, Discord, Linkedin, or any other socials by sending them links of your issue or PRs. They are getting notifications from projects they maintain and you are adding more notifications. This will create more confusion for maintainers. Remember, most of these people maintaining projects are from different time zones. Many of them are maintaining open-source project in addition of their work. Be patience! You can give them a friendly reminder after 1 week or such.</p>
<p>✅<strong>Do this</strong></p>
