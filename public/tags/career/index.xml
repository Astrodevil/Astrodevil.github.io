I was searching for a few good technical writers who could publish great blogs about AI/ML, web development tutorials, or even general articles. For this, I reviewed technical writers from Hashnode, Dev, Medium, other platforms, and many from the portfolios shared on my X post. Most were good writers, but their profiles lacked a few things as technical writers.</p>
<p>In this article, I&rsquo;ll be sharing my findings from their portfolios so that you can make your profile better as a technical writer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>This article addresses beginners and writers eager to improve themselves as technical writers.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="casual-writer-or-technical-writer">Casual Writer or Technical Writer</h2>
<p>Many writers have published a few articles based on their learnings, but this doesn&rsquo;t necessarily make them technical writers. These articles may be as brief as social media posts, raising doubts about whether the authors can produce substantial technical blogs. Being a technical writer means regularly publishing articles that cover a diverse range of topics in a well-explained and detailed manner.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to differentiate between those who write occasional technical briefs and dedicated technical writers who produce comprehensive and in-depth articles. While casual writers may create technically accurate content, their work often lacks the depth and detail required for true technical writing.</p>
<p>This distinction is crucial, as technical writing demands not only expertise but also the ability to convey complex information clearly in a professional or simple manner.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t write just for money, write if you love or care to contribute to the tech community as a writer.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="lack-of-ownership">Lack of Ownership</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve observed that many writers don&rsquo;t take full ownership of their work. Even though they have articles published on company blogs or platforms like freeCodeCamp, these pieces often don&rsquo;t make it into their personal portfolios or websites.</p>
<p>Scattered links aren&rsquo;t effective, even for established writers. It&rsquo;s important to claim your content and make sure your name is prominently associated with it. Here are some steps to improve your ownership:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Take Credit for Your Work</strong>: Make sure your name is on every article you write. If you&rsquo;re publishing on third-party platforms, ask for a byline or include a headshot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use a Professional Profile Picture</strong>: Adding a professional profile picture helps readers connect with you on a personal level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Centralize Your Work</strong>: Collect all your published articles in one place, such as a personal website or an online portfolio. This makes it easier for potential clients or employers to see the evidence of your work.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By taking these steps, you can better showcase your skills and accomplishments, making it easier for others to recognize and appreciate your work.</p>

<h2 id="no-personal-profiles">No Personal Profiles</h2>
<p>Another significant gap I noticed is the absence of personal blogging profiles among many technical writers. While contributing to company blogs or external platforms can be valuable, having a personal blog that you control is essential for establishing your unique voice and showcasing your expertise.</p>
<p>A personal blog allows you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Demonstrate Expertise</strong>: Regularly publish content that highlights your knowledge and skills in technical writing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Showcase Work</strong>: Share detailed case studies, project overviews, and examples of your writing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Build Authority</strong>: Establish yourself as a thought leader in your field by discussing industry trends, best practices, and innovative techniques.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Engage with Community</strong>: Foster a community of peers, potential clients, and employers who can interact with your content, providing feedback and building professional relationships.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enhance SEO</strong>: Improve your visibility online through search engine optimization, making it easier for others to find and connect with you.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Investing in a personal blog can significantly enhance your career prospects and professional reputation, offering a platform that you fully control to present your best work and insights.</p>
<h2 id="lack-of-branding">Lack of Branding</h2>
<p>Another significant gap is the lack of personal branding among many technical writers. Closely related to personal profiles, personal branding involves establishing a unique identity that sets you apart from others in your field. It entails consistently presenting yourself and your work in a way that reflects your values, expertise, and professional goals.</p>
<p>Effective personal branding can help you:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Stand Out in a Crowded Market</strong>: Differentiate yourself from other technical writers by showcasing your unique skills and perspective.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Attract More Opportunities</strong>: Gain visibility and appeal to potential clients, employers, and collaborators.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Command Higher Rates</strong>: Establish a reputation for quality and expertise, allowing you to charge premium rates for your services.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Building a strong personal brand requires a strategic approach, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>A Professional Website</strong>: Create a central hub for your portfolio, services, and contact information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A Cohesive Social Media Presence</strong>: Maintain consistent and professional profiles across various platforms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Regular Audience Engagement</strong>: Share your insights through blogs, articles, or speaking engagements to demonstrate your knowledge and stay connected with your audience.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Investing in personal branding can significantly enhance your career prospects and professional reputation, positioning you as a leader in your field.</p>

It is a three-month-long Open-Source Program conducted by the GirlScript Foundation for beginners. This year I am selected as project admin for the program. (GSSOC'22)</p>
<p>In this article, I am going to share my experiences from being a contributor in an open-source program to the project admin &amp; mentor of one.</p>
<h3 id="how-i-started">How I started?</h3>
<p>My first open-source contribution was to a friend&rsquo;s repository. After doing some small contributions I came to know about GSSoC program and I took part in it. This was the first big contribution from my side to any open source project. Before that, I had some experience contributing to <strong>EbookFoundation / free-programming-books</strong>. From that, I learned to communicate over issues and to make pull requests properly. This previous work helped me a lot during GirlScript Summer of Code.</p>
<h3 id="what-i-learned">What I Learned?</h3>
<p>Successful contributions during the program definitely acted as a confidence booster for me. Now, I was more confident to work on any open-source project. While contributing I went through some issues and pull requests where project maintainers were discussing things and I tried to understand their workflow, and how they manage things.</p>
<p>After some time, I decided to take part as a project admin in an open-source program. Hacktoberfest was the best time to do so because many newbies were going to start their open source contributions in the month of October.</p>
<h3 id="what-next">What Next?</h3>
<p>I had created a repository to host small JavaScript projects. It was for personal use first but after the decision of participating as a project admin, I created a GitHub organization <a href="https://github.com/ZeroOctave" target="_blank" class="highlight-line">ZeroOctave</a> and added the same repository inside that. Hacktoberfest was going to start so I thought of taking my chances and as expected some good contributions were added to the repository. I was enjoying my role as a maintainer while guiding contributors for the contribution to my repository.</p>
<p>Just after Hacktoberfest, some more open-source programs were going to start so I applied with my repository and got accepted in two of them. Those programs were <a href="https://icc-techsahead.netlify.app/" target="_blank" class="highlight-line">Infinite Clone Conspiracy</a> &amp; <a href="https://dwoc.io/" target="_blank" class="highlight-line">DWoC'21</a>. These programs were not big enough to attract many contributors but still some good projects were added to our repository and some new members also joined the GitHub organization.</p>
<h3 id="gssoc">GSSoC!</h3>
<p>GSSoC stands for <s>Google</s> GirlScript Summer of Code. As I mentioned earlier, GSSoC'21 acted as the starting step for my open source journey. After 1 year when another version of GSSoC came back, I decided to participate in my project this time. I filled out the registration form with my organization and project details and got selected as project admin. It&rsquo;s a 3-month long program currently going on, many new contributions are coming into our organization repository. <a href="https://github.com/ZeroOctave/ZeroOctave-Javascript-Projects" target="_blank" class="highlight-line">ZeroOctave Javascript Projects</a> is our project repository that is the part of GSSoC'22. Till now 200+ issues created and 200+ pull requests merged.</p>
<p>While doing my work as project admin and coordinating with my project maintainers, I am also focused on enhancing my tech skills. So that I can contribute to some good open-source projects out there.</p>
<h3 id="invitation-for-you">Invitation For You!</h3>
<p>If you are a beginner, you are welcome to contribute to our organization. If you are an active open source contributor or maintainer, you are welcome to join ZeroOctave. Join zeroOctave to add your projects, guide newbies or write articles related to open source.</p>

In the software industry, Open Source projects are widely regarded now. How can recruiters know that the abilities you claim to have are truly the skills you have? When you&rsquo;re a fresher with no professional experience open-source contributions come in useful. Without any prior industry expertise, GitHub allows you to exhibit your work. As a result, it&rsquo;s important to make GitHub Profile stand out and present the best version of yourself.</p>
<p>In this article, I am shedding light on tips to <strong>Make Your GitHub Profile Standout To Attract Better Opportunities</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction!</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Astrodevil" target="_blank" class="highlight-line"><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1643986105138/0oFtVvL6rO.png" alt="screely-1643985124626.png"  />
</a></p>
<p>The above screenshot is of my GitHub profile. I have mentioned my bio in a detailed manner, including contribution graphs, badges, tech stack, proper name, username, profile picture, social handles, and my side hustles. You can also create your GitHub profile like mine or even better. Isn&rsquo;t my profile more detailed and attractive than resume? I hope after seeing the above screenshot you also want to make your GitHub profile stand out. <em>Let&rsquo;s get started!</em></p>
<h2 id="foundation-stone">Foundation Stone</h2>
<p>As you know already, the repository is the main feature of GitHub where every project, content, code is stored properly.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start by creating a special repository after signing in to your GitHub account. <strong>This repository name must be same as your GitHub username</strong>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1643985010957/IkhnHnKtE.png" alt="screely-1643984983985.png"  />
</p>
<p>This is a ✨special ✨ repository that you can use to add a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes" target="_blank" class="highlight-line">README.md</a> to your GitHub profile. Make sure it’s public and initialize it with a README or create a README.md file inside this repository to get started.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown" target="_blank" class="highlight-line">Markdown</a> will be used to add contents and details in <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes" target="_blank" class="highlight-line">README</a> file. Learn Markdown syntax from this <a href="https://github.com/Astrodevil/Open-Source-Gallery/blob/main/src/markdown-cheatsheet.pdf" target="_blank" class="highlight-line">cheetsheet</a>. README files are commonly used to write documentation for the project repositories.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to add contents in your profile README.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3 id="header">Header</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the header, you can add your name, greet message, photo or gif, or nothing according to your choice. I am using my profile-related codes, you can change accordingly.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code># Hi, I&#39;m Astrodevil &lt;img src=&#34;https://github.com/TheDudeThatCode/TheDudeThatCode/blob/master/Assets/Hi.gif&#34; width=&#34;29px&#34;&gt;

</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3 id="about">About</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the About section you can add your little introduction, What you are working on, What are your goals or something like that.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code># replace contents according to you.

</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3 id="contribution-graph">Contribution Graph</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I have added a contribution graph banner to update daily activity from my GitHub profile. It&rsquo;s a nice way to showcase if you are active frequently and doing some contributions in projects. This graph is updating daily automatically.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code> # replace username with your own or change theme

</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3 id="icons--badges">Icons &amp; Badges</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Adding <strong>social handles</strong> on GitHub profile is the best way to connect with peoples and transfer more audience towards your socials. You can use badges for that or icons. You can create badges from <a href="https://shields.io/" target="_blank" class="highlight-line">shields.io</a> and also use icons from <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/social-media" target="_blank" class="highlight-line">flaticon</a>. There are tons of site to find attractive icons. You can also add information about your tech stack and tools you are familiar with by using badges and icons.

<h3 id="stats-card">Stats Card</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Adding Stats cards to your GitHub page is another common profile enhancement. This is a simple method to display all of your GitHub statistics in a fun, visual way. You can also track your GitHub Streak.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code># replace username with your own or change theme

</p>
<p>These are the basic customization method that can make your GitHub profile stand out, I used my profile as an example to explain above. You can also add more customization in your GitHub profile README to make it detailed and attractive. <em>Let&rsquo;s see that in next section</em>.</p>
<h2 id="building">Building</h2>
<ul>
<li>You can also <strong>track your activity</strong> and showcase it on your profile README by using a GitHub Action Scripts. Just create <code>/.github/workflows/update-readme.yml</code> inside the repository and paste below code inside update-readme.yml file. This script updates activity every 30 minutes.</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>name: Update README

      - uses: jamesgeorge007/github-activity-readme@master
        env:
