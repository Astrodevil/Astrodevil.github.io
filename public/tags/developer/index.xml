<p>Honestly, I am not happy with my 2022 work and learning.</p>
<p>Not finishing what I started to learn, be it DSA or Web development. Not written as many blogs as I planned a year back. Lots of mismanagement happened due to shifts in my college work. I had online classes till the first half of 2022 and after that, I got to attend offline classes. this messed up my whole planning and I wasn&rsquo;t able to manage it well.</p>
<p>Mistakes are never meant to be repeated and I am keeping them in check from now on. Offline classes and semester exams had taken lots of time and mismanagement adds fire to that. I can&rsquo;t repeat these mistakes in 2023. I didn&rsquo;t compete for my bigger goal this year.</p>
<h2 id="2023-goals">2023 Goals🎯</h2>
<p>I am not aiming too high for the next year&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Just want to finish what I started to learn.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Will contribute to open source on a more regular basis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Writing articles more often.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finding Internships or Technical writing opportunities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="wrap">Wrap🧵</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to learn from mistakes than get into repentance. This time with proper time management. I know now that my classes are offline and learning will be planned accordingly. My Internship season is approaching soon and I have to be ready for that. Lots of things to be achieved but have to go one step at a time.</p>
<p>I am going to be more active this time on Twitter and will continue to load my Instagram with lots of Tech content. Will be learning &amp; creating content in public.</p>
<p>Lots of good content in 2023!👍🏼</p>

<p>Programming without code is a concise definition. It is the use of no-code tools that allow you to create a fully functional, responsive web application or website without writing any code. However, it goes a little deeper than that.</p>
<p>Every piece of technology, including no-code platforms, is developed with code. The distinction is that no-code platforms provide building elements that are required by any website or application, such as pages, data storage and display, individual user profiles, and file upload. People may then link them into their own program using drag and drop or other &ldquo;human-understood&rdquo; actions that do not require coding.</p>
