With GitHub Actions, you can automate, customize, and execute your software development workflows right in your repository. You may find, create, and distribute actions for any job you want to do, including CI/CD, and combine actions in a fully customized workflow.

- [Twitter, together!](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/twitter-together): This GitHub Action uses text files to post tweets from a GitHub repository for Open Source or event maintainers who share a project Twitter account. GitHub's pull request review mechanism, rather than tweeting directly, encourages increased collaboration, Twitter engagement, and editorial input by allowing anyone to submit a tweet draft to a project.
