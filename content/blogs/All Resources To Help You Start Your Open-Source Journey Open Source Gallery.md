Open-Source-Gallery provides you with all the resources needed to become a good open-sourcer.

The motiveüéØ of this project is to help new learners like you to get familiar with the world of open-source.

Every Learner has different preferences, some find docs are easy to understand and learn from there, some prefer video. I have taken care of all that while curating these resources.

### What Else‚ö°
I have also included some [other resources](https://github.com/Astrodevil/Open-Source-Gallery#more-resource-gallery) and resources gallery apart from open source. Hope it will help you in your learning.

This resource gallery was 1st curated on Notion but now it is hosted on GitHub. If you find this helpful, don't forget to give it a [‚≠ê](https://github.com/Astrodevil/Open-Source-Gallery) on GitHub.

Happy learning.üëç
