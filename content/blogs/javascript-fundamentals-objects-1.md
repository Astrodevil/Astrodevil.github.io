Today is the 13th day of my **#100DaysOfCode** journey with JavaScript.

I write about my learnings in an explained way through my [blogs](https://astrodevil.hashnode.dev/) and socials. If you want to join me on the learning journey, make sure to follow my blogs and social and share yours too. **Let's learn together!ü´±üèº‚Äçü´≤üèº**

This Article is a part of the [JavaScript Fundamentals](https://blog.mranand.com/series/js-fundamentals) series.

### Objects

In JavaScript, almost "everything" is an object. JavaScript objects start with an open curly-brace `{` and end with a closed curly brace `}`. It contains key-value pairs in between these braces.

```javascript
const team = {
    name: "India",
    wins: 91,
    inFinals: true,
};
```

In above object `team`, we have three keys: `name`, `wins` and `inFinals`. The value associated with `name` is `"India"`, with `wins` is `86` and with `inFinals` is `true`.

**Example:** Let's create an object representing a pizza order! In the `order` object, add the following three keys with values accordingly:

`pizzas` - Any number greater than zero.

`extraCheese` - A boolean. Either `true` or `false`.

`deliveryInstructions` - Any string of instructions.

```javascript
const order = {
    pizzas: 5,
    extraCheese: true,
    deliveryInstructions: "Keep it medium",
};
```

### Retrieve Values

Now we will retrieve values from object. From the given code, If we wanted to retrieve the name of the team, we can do this in two ways:

```javascript
const team = {
    name: "India",
    wins: 91,
    inFinals: true,
};
```

```javascript
console.log( team.name ); // India
console.log( team['name'] ); // India
```

Brackets `[]` or `.` property accessor operator can be used, similar to arrays!

### Array of Objects

Now, we will see what happens if we put objects inside arrays and vice versa.

Let's take our team example again:

```javascript
const team = {
    name: "India",
    wins: 91,
    inFinals: true,
};
```

What if we have multiple teams:

```javascript
const teams = [India, Australia, England];
for(let i = 0; i < teams.length; i++) {
    console.log(teams[i].name); 
}
```

This example loops over each team and logs out the name of each team.

**Example:** Given an array of pizza orders, return the total number of pizzas ordered. The `orders` are an array of objects, each with `pizzas` key inside.

```javascript
function numberOfPizzas(orders) {
    let total = 0;
    for(let i = 0; i < orders.length; i++) {
        total += orders[i].pizzas;
    }
    return total;
}
```

### Conclusion

Ending with an extra bit of information about JavaScript...

A JavaScript object is a state-and-behaviour-containing entity (properties and method). Examples include a car, pen, bicycle, chair, glass, keyboard, and monitor. JavaScript is an object-based¬†language. In JavaScript, everything is an object. JavaScript relies on templates rather than classes. To obtain the object in this case, no class is created. But we deliberately make objects.

**Today I learned about Objects in JavaScript.**
