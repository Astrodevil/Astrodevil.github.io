Today is the 4th day of my **#100DaysOfCode** journey with JavaScript.

I write about my learnings in an explained way through my [blogs](https://astrodevil.hashnode.dev/) and socials. If you want to join me on the learning journey, make sure to follow my blogs and social and share yours too. **Let's learn together!ü´±üèº‚Äçü´≤üèº**

This Article is a part of the [JavaScript Fundamentals](https://blog.mranand.com/series/js-fundamentals) series.

Today, I learned about `Math.random`, `Math.floor` Functions and to call a function within our function.

### Math.random

In JavaScript, there are many math utilities on the `Math` object. To get a random number we can call the `Math.random` function.

```javascript
const myRandomNumber = Math.random();
```

The above line will return some number between `0` and `1` (not including `1`). `Math.random` can also be used to generate random numbers between the range.

**Example:** Inside `getRandom`, get a random number from the `Math.random()` function. Then, return that number!üëáüèº

```javascript
function getRandom() {
    return Math.random();
}
```

A random number between `0` and `100` could be created by simply multiplying the output:

```javascript
// randomNumber will be between 0 and 100
const randomNumber = Math.random() * 100;
```

We could multiply and then add to get a random number between `15` and `100`:

```javascript
// randomNumber will be between 15 and 100
const randomNumber = (Math.random() * 85) + 15;
```

### Math.floor

`Math.floor` takes arguments.

```javascript
const two = Math.floor(2.2598223);
```

`Math.floor` function will take `2.2598223` and return `2`. A number will be rounded to the nearest integer using this function. For instance, if the input was `2.9999`, the method would round it to `2`.

**Example:** Take the argument `x` and use `Math.floor` to turn it into an integer without the values after the decimal place. Once you have this floored value, return it!

```javascript
function getFloor(x) {
    return Math.floor(x);
}
```

### Conclusion

Ending with an extra bit of information about JavaScript functions...

The JavaScript Math object allows us to perform mathematical tasks on numbers. There are various math object properties.

**Today I learned about Math.random, Math.floor Functions in JavaScript.**
